	abstract = {Ecosystem collapse, i.e. the endpoint of ecosystem decline, is a central concept of IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) assessments and the identification of ecosystems most vulnerable to global environmental change. Estimating collapse risk can be challenging for ecosystems reliant on a few dominant species to perform most of their functions because the range of suitable and feasible indicators is small. This study investigates the robustness and adequacy of the current RLE approach for risk assessments in such ecosystems, using a fringe mangrove ecosystem as a case study. Following the RLE protocol, we constructed a conceptual model of the key ecosystem processes for the Philippines’ fringe mangrove forests. Satellite remote sensing data and existing maps of mangrove forests were then combined to assess the spatial distribution of the ecosystem considered (Criteria A and B), while the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index was used to assess biotic degradation (Criterion D). Insufficient data were available to assess Criteria C (environmental degradation) and E (quantitative analysis). Overall, the ecosystem was assessed as ‘Least Concern’ based on extensive geographic distribution and only weak support for declines in extent. Criterion D was classed as ‘Data Deficient’ since there was no clear relationship between the vegetation index and fringe mangrove degradation. Our results demonstrate how gaps in our appreciation and understanding of the structure and functioning of ecosystems are more likely to impede risk assessments of ecosystems characterised by a small number of foundation species, due to the low level of redundancy between candidate indicators available for their assessments. Satellite remote sensing combined with derivation of explicit conceptual ecosystem models provides a way to structure efforts to identify suitable indicators as well as opportunities to overcome many of these challenges, even for relatively data-poor ecosystems. © 2018},

	abstract = {Current biodiversity loss is far greater than at any time in human history. As complementary tool to prioritize biodiversity for conservation, the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) is well justified as a conservation tool. Although China's biodiversity is among the world's richest, a significant part of this diversity is under threat. Based on the distribution of 229 forest formations, we assessed the risk status according to the IUCN RLE criteria, and evaluated the conservation status of threatened forests by comparing ecosystem distribution with terrestrial national and provincial nature reserves (NNRs and PNRs, respectively). We found that 90 threatened forest formations accounted for 16% of the area, but for 39.3% of the number of assessed formations. Threatened forest formations were mainly located in western Sichuan, Yunnan, southeastern Xizang, southwestern Guangxi, Hainan Island, northeastern China, and the mountains of Taiwan. Tropical rain forests and evergreen broad-leaved forests together accounted for the highest number of threatened formations. Northern Xinjiang (with the Tianshan and Altai Mountains) proved to be a unique area that has rarely been identified as hotspot of plant conservation. On average, NNRs covered 13.2%, and NNRs and PNRs together covered 22.7%, of the threatened forest distribution areas. However, 15 threatened forest formations were not covered by NNRs or PNRs. We suggest that the red list of ecosystems will contribute towards providing a more informative picture of the status of biodiversity. Our work highlights the need to use the red list of ecosystems as additional tool in plant conservation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {One of the challenges of computational-centric research is to make the research undertaken reproducible in a form that others can repeat and re-use with minimal effort. In addition to the data and tools necessary to re-run analyses, execution environments play crucial roles because of the dependencies of the operating system and software version used. However, some of the challenges of reproducible science can be addressed using appropriate computational tools and cloud computing to provide an execution environment. Here, we demonstrate the use of a Kepler scientific workflow for reproducible science that is sharable, reusable, and re-executable. These workflows reduce barriers to sharing and will save researchers time when undertaking similar research in the future. To provide infrastructure that enables reproducible science, we have developed cloud-based Collaborative Environment for Ecosystem Science Research and Analysis (CoESRA) infrastructure to build, execute and share sophisticated computation-centric research. The CoESRA provides users with a storage and computational platform that is accessible from a web-browser in the form of a virtual desktop. Any registered user can access the virtual desktop to build, execute and share the Kepler workflows. This approach will enable computational scientists to share complete workflows in a pre-configured environment so that others can reproduce the computational research with minimal effort. As a case study, we developed and shared a complete IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Assessment workflow that reproduces the assessments undertaken by Burns et al. (2015) on Mountain Ash forests in the Central Highlands of Victoria, Australia. This workflow provides an opportunity for other researchers and stakeholders to run this assessment with minimal supervision. The workflow also enables researchers to re-evaluate the assessment when additional data becomes available. The assessment can be run in a CoESRA virtual desktop by opening a workflow in a Kepler user interface and pressing a “start” button. The workflow is pre-configured with all the open access datasets and writes results to a pre-configured folder. © 2016},

	abstract = {Introduction: Human activities represent a growing threat to biodiversity, increasing species extinction and leading ecosystems to collapse. The knowledge of the spatial distribution of threats to ecosystems is fundamental to understanding their risk of collapse as defined by the Red List of Ecosystems, an International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) global standard to guide conservation and management actions. Colombia is a megadiverse country; almost half of its territory is marine, and its ecosystems are subject to anthropogenic and climatic threats. Methodology: This study provides a quantitative map assessment for a set of relevant anthropic and climatic threats and impacts on the marine and coastal areas of Colombia, intending to perform the threat description component of the Red List assessment protocol. A cumulative impact assessment was applied to analyze the threat levels (TLs) and impact levels of 12 anthropogenic and climatic pressures. Results: The observed TL patterns meet spatial expectations, revealing that the assessment units in the Caribbean Sea are more threatened than those in the Pacific Ocean, and continental areas are more threatened than the oceanic ones. Habitat transformation and sea warming were the threats with the most impact on coastal and marine ecosystems, respectively. Climatic threats were widely extended throughout the study area, occurring even in the most pristine zones (e.g., Malpelo Island). Discussion: Climate threats are challenging to national conservation strategies since these pressures are not completely manageable at local scales as they depend mainly on global efforts. Recommendations drawn from this work can guide actions for the conservation of the ecosystems of Colombia.

	abstract = {Sea-level rise is an inevitable consequence of climate change and threatens coastal ecosystems, particularly intertidal habitats that are constrained by landward development. Intertidal habitats support significant biodiversity, but also provide natural buffers from climate-threats such as increased storm events. Predicting the effects of climate scenarios on coastal ecosystems is important for understanding both the degree of habitat loss for associated ecological communities and the risk of the loss of coastal buffer zones. We take a novel approach by combining remote sensing with the IUCN Red List of Ecosystem criteria to assess this impact. We quantified the extent of horizontal intertidal rocky shores along ~200 km of coastline in Eastern Australia using GIS and remote-sensing (LiDAR) and used this information to predict changes in extent under four different climate change driven sea-level rise scenarios. We then applied the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Criterion C2 (habitat degradation over the next 50 years based on change in an abiotic variable) to estimate the status of this ecosystem using the Hawkesbury Shelf Marine Bioregion as a test coastline. We also used four individual rocky shores as case studies to investigate the role of local topography in determining the severity of sea-level rise impacts. We found that, if the habitat loss within the study area is representative of the entire bioregion, the IUCN status of this ecosystem is ‘near threatened’, assuming that an assessment of the other criteria would return lower categories of risk. There was, however, high spatial variability in this effect. Rocky shores with gentle slopes had the highest projected losses of area whereas rocky shores expanding above the current intertidal range were less affected. Among the sites surveyed in detail, the ecosystem status ranged from ‘least concern’ to ‘vulnerable’, but reached ‘endangered’ under upper estimates of the most severe scenario. Our results have important implications for conservation management, highlighting a new link between remote sensing and the IUCN Red List of Ecosystem criteria that can be applied worldwide to assess ecosystem risk to sea-level rise. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Five years on, it is timely to ask what impact this new initiative has had on ecosystem management and conservation. In this policy perspective, we use an impact evaluation framework to distinguish the outputs, outcomes, and impacts of the RLE since its inception. To date, 2,821 ecosystems in 100 countries have been assessed following the RLE protocol. Systematic assessments are complete or underway in 21 countries and two continental regions (the Americas and Europe). Countries with established ecosystem policy infrastructure have already used the RLE to inform legislation, land-use planning, protected area management, monitoring and reporting, and ecosystem management. Impacts are still emerging due to varying pace and commitment to implementation across different countries. In the future, RLE indices based on systematic assessments have high potential to inform global biodiversity reporting. Expanding the coverage of RLE assessments, building capacity and political will to undertake them, and establishing stronger policy instruments to manage red-listed ecosystems will be key to maximizing conservation impacts over the coming decades. © 2019 The Authors.

The criterions used in the index were: (1) Remnant Vegetation Index, (2) Delphi Method Survey, and (3) Rapid Assessment Questionnaire. In turn, the weights of the criterions were defined using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Once the values of each criterion were obtained, the index was applied to 17 mangrove communities located in La Paz Bay, Mexico. Finally, according to their score, they were classified based on the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems. The results show that five communities were ranked in the category Minor Concern, eight in Little Threatened, one in Vulnerable, one in Endangered, and two were classified as Deficiency of Data. These results are slightly different from other studies in the region and validate this index as a proper method.

	abstract = {Ecosystem status assessments are generally separated into realm-specific analyses (terrestrial, freshwater, estuarine or marine), but without integrating these into a coherent assessment of coastal biodiversity across the land–sea interface. Trends in assessment indicators in coastal versus non-coastal areas have also rarely been considered. In this study we aimed to compile the first cross-realm national biodiversity assessment for the South African coast using three key indicators. The ecological condition, ecosystem threat status, and ecosystem protection level of coastal ecosystem types (n = 186) were determined and compared with those of non-coastal ecosystem types (n = 444). Nearly half (46.9%) of the South African coastal habitat has been degraded compared with 20% of non-coastal areas. Proportionately, there are three-times (60%) as many threatened coastal ecosystem types (or 55% by area) as there are threatened non-coastal ecosystem types (19%, 6% by area). Despite the impacted state of coastal biodiversity, protection levels are generally higher in the coastal zone (87% of ecosystem types have some protection) compared with non-coastal areas (75%), although fewer coastal ecosystem types have met their biodiversity targets (24%, vs 28% for non-coastal ecosystem types). These results illustrate the importance of using a cross-realm approach for status assessments, management and conservation of coastal biodiversity. The assessment methods described are flexible and widely applicable to other regions. © 2022 The Author(s). Co-published by NISC Pty (Ltd) and Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

We applied the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, we find that 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types. © 2018 The Authors.

	abstract = {The human impact on nature has now reached a level at which the well-being of future human society is at risk. Therefore, transformative change in society is needed. Environmental assessments contribute to shaping environmental policy, potentially leveraging transformative change. Red Lists are a key information source on the state of biodiversity. Our aim was to study the Red List authors’ perceptions of how Red Lists contribute to leveraging sustainability changes. We interviewed 15 of the authors of the forest and peatland sections of the Finnish Red List of Ecosystems 2018. We used the framework of sustainability leverage points to locate sustainability changes that Red Lists have leveraged in the social part of the Finnish social-ecological system. Our results show how the assessors perceived the influence of the Red Lists at most of the leverage points, including the deepest ones, and how these influences simultaneously co-exist in several leverage points. The most prominent sustainability changes were linked with legislation and information flows, whereas current paradigms, system goals and legislation appeared to prevent Red Lists from leveraging sustainability changes in Finland. We conclude that the production and dissemination processes of Red List knowledge can make an important contribution to sustainability changes. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The Red List of Habitats of the Czech Republic assesses the risk of collapse for 157 types of natural and semi-natural habitats defined in the second edition of the Habitat Catalogue of the Czech Republic. The assessment followed the guidelines for the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems as used in the European Red List of Habitats project, using the criteria of habitat reduction in quantity, restricted geographic distribution, and reduction in abiotic and biotic quality. Quantitative data for the assessment were partly taken from a detailed field habitat mapping at the national scale, and where no quantitative information was available, the values were estimated by summarizing independent judgements of 17 experts. In addition to the criteria involved in the Red List assessment, the experts also assessed various types of threatening factors and their importance for each habitat. Of 157 assessed habitats, 2 were Collapsed (CO), 14 Critically Endangered (CR), 32 Endangered (EN), 33 Vulnerable (VU), 30 Near Threatened (NT) and 46 Least Concern (LC). The largest proportion of CR + EN habitats was in the habitat group of springs and mires and in the group of wetlands. The threatening factors evaluated as the most important were successional changes after cessation of traditional management, eutrophication due to atmospheric nutrient deposition and pollution from agriculture, and increased drought in water-dependent habitats due to climate change or changes in local hydrological regime. The study shows that the IUCN criteria for Red List assessment of habitats, although developed for the global scale, are also applicable within small countries or regions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Our indices quantify changes in risk of ecosystem collapse, ecosystem area and ecological processes, and capture variation in underlying patterns among ecosystems. We apply the indices to three case studies of regional and national assessments (American/Caribbean forests, terrestrial ecosystems of Colombia, and terrestrial ecosystems of South Africa) to illustrate the indices’ complementarity and versatility in revealing patterns of interest for users across sectors.

The approach provides the scientific basis for the U.S. National Vegetation Classification, Canadian National Vegetation Classification and NatureServe's International Vegetation Classification, and has encouraged international and national collaborations elsewhere in the Americas. The approach is global, but most advanced in the western hemisphere, especially the U.S. and Canada. EcoVeg provides a consistent thematic framework to support extensive vegetation mapping across the U.S. and Latin America. The approach provides an 8-level hierarchy for natural types, with three upper (formation) levels, three mid (physiognomic-biogeographic-floristic) levels and 2 lower (floristic) levels, and a separate 8-level hierarchy for cultural types. Types are maintained through a review board to ensure consistent definition. All protocols use the best available scientific information, including plot data and secondary sources. Preferred plot sizes typically range from 0.01 to 0.1 ha (to 1.0 ha in tropical vegetation). Plot data include full species lists by strata with cover values, and supporting environmental and site data. The classification approach meets the need for a dynamic, 8- level catalog of types for all existing vegetation. The open, peer-review model allows for ongoing improvement by ecologists, while always providing comprehensive versions for users. Use of the best available scientific information ensures that the legacy of previous classification efforts is fully incorporated. Limitations include somewhat complicated names for types, limited availability of comprehensive plot data sets, and sparse testing beyond the Americas and Africa. The conservation or at-risk status of macrogroups, groups and associations are evaluated using both the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems and NatureServe Conservation Status Assessment protocols. © 2017 Gebrüder Borntraeger, 70176 Stuttgart, Germany.},

	abstract = {Tidal flats provide ecosystem services to billions of people worldwide, yet their changing status is largely unknown. In the Yellow Sea region of East Asia, tidal flats are the principal coastal ecosystem fringing more than 4000km of the coastlines of China, North Korea and South Korea. However, widespread loss of areal extent, increasing frequency of algal blooms, hypoxic dead zones and jellyfish blooms, and declines of commercial fisheries and migratory bird populations suggest that this ecosystem is degraded and declining. Here, we apply the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Ecosystems criteria to the Yellow Sea tidal flat ecosystem and determine that its status is endangered. Comparison of standardized remotely sensed habitat data and historic topographic map data indicated that in the last 50 years, a decline of more than 50% but less than 80% of tidal flat extent has occurred (criterion A1). Although restricted to a narrow band along the coastline, Yellow Sea tidal flats are sufficiently broadly distributed to be classified as least concern under criterion B. However, widespread pollution, algal blooms and declines of invertebrate and vertebrate fauna across the region result in a classification of endangered (C1, D1). Owing to the lack of long-term monitoring data and the unknown impacts of severe biotic and abiotic change, the ecosystem was scored as data deficient for Criterion E and several subcriteria. Our assessment demonstrates an urgent need to arrest the decline of the Yellow Sea tidal flat ecosystem, which could be achieved by (i) improved coastal planning and management at regional and national levels, (ii) expansion of the coastal protected area network, and (iii) improved managed of existing protected areas to reduce illegal land reclamation and coastal exploitation. © 2015 The Authors.

	abstract = {Climate change is likely to shift the distributions of ecosystems worldwide. Most assessments of climate change are primarily species-focused and do not directly estimate how entire ecosystems may change. Using an ecosystem-based modelling approach, we provide a region-wide climate change vulnerability assessment of the seven major ecosystems across Africa's Albertine Rift. The Albertine Rift is a global biodiversity hotspot, containing more endemic vertebrates than anywhere else in Africa. We used Maxent to estimate each ecosystem's extent using current climate data, then we projected the potential distribution of each ecosystem for 2050 and 2070. We found that suitable conditions for most ecosystems are predicted to contract rapidly in extent and shift upwards in altitude. High-altitude ecosystems and the endemic species they support are at immediate risk, owing to rapid predicted shrinkage in their suitable extent. Only the Combretum-grasslands savannah ecosystem is predicted to expand, with suitable conditions increasing by 32% in area by 2050. The extent and structure of boundary zones between the Rift's ecosystems may change significantly through time, due to the contractions and shifts of the environmental conditions for existing ecosystem distributions. By 2070, 44% of the region could be climatically unsuitable for the current ecosystems. Conservation planning across the Rift will need to account for these ecosystem shifts and rapidly changing boundary zones to ensure the long-term persistence of the many endemic species. Beyond the Albertine Rift, this ecosystem-based modelling technique can be adapted to any terrestrial region, providing critical information for conservation vulnerability assessments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the past decades Romania’s forest habitats suffered from human activity impact, resulting in loss of biodiversity and ecosystems services, thus highlighting the need for improved conservation measures. In 2008 the IUCN initiated a global Red List of ecosystems (Resolution 4.020, IV World Conservation Congress in Barcelona). The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems is planned to be a standard for assessing the status of ecosystems, which is applicable at local, national, regional and global level. In this article highlights the proposed methodology in our country and presents the scientific arguments of using certain indicators. A number of eight criteria and four categories of threat were identified and selected for reliable assessment of the current state of Romanian forest habitats. To establish the categories of threat a starting point for these categories was the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The proposed method will provide information on the types of data necessary to monitor habitat status: estimates of area, measures of ecological function in virgin forests and degraded habitats and quantification of the severity of threats. The improved methodology will give authorities a new tool to help conservation, management, and restoration of endangered forest habitats. © SGEM 2018.},

	abstract = {The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems has been employed to assess the status of ecosystems and evaluate the risk of their collapse. The RLE assessment was conducted on the main ecosystems of the marine bar of Burullus wetland; sand plain and salt marshes ecosystems of the marine bar which separates the lake from the Mediterranean Sea. Four criteria were used for conducting the assessment; (A) reduction in distribution, (B) constricted distribution, (C) abiotic components degradation, and (D) disruption of biotic processes and interactions. The integration of remotely-sensed data allowed the application of RLE to study the changes in ecosystems distribution for Criteria A and B. Criterion A showed the same result for sand plain and salt marshes as Critically Endangered (CR). This indicates the distribution of the marine bar is extremely affected by the urban and human activities in the region. It is also expected to be affected by any slight changes in the sea-level and costal erosions in the future in terms of disruption in biotic processes and interactions. Criteria D was applied using floristic quality assessment for current floristic composition and the available historic data. The results show that sand plain and salt marshes are Near Threatened (NT). However, the application of Criteria C was Data Deficient DD due to lack of long term data about the abiotic variables responsible for environmental degradation. The identical results of RLE assessment of sand plain and salt marshes reflect that both ecosystems are equally affected by the ongoing activities in the region, particularly over the last few years. The results indicate that the marine bar ecosystems were disturbed by anthropogenic events such as urban development, grazing and farming. Also natural events such as climate change and its consequences are expected to have severe impacts on the marine bar in the future. Therefore, further studies should focus on the study of the main interactions and processes in the marine bar ecosystems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Threats to ecosystems are closely linked to human development, whereas lack, insufficiency, and inefficiency of public policies are important drivers of environmental decline. Previous studies have discussed the contribution of IUCN's Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) in conservation issues; however, its applications in different policy fields and instruments for achieving biodiversity conservation have not been explored in detail. Here, we introduce a framework to operationalize the RLE in public policy, facilitating work of governments, practitioners, and decision makers. Our analysis identified 20 policy instruments that could reduce risks to ecosystems highlighted by different Red List criteria. We discuss how RLE could inform the policy process by analyzing different instruments that could be designed, implemented, and modified to achieve risk reduction. We also present practical examples from around the world showing how ecosystem conservation could be improved by operationalizing the RLE in policy instruments. The RLE criteria can inform the policy process by helping to shape objectives and identifying policy instruments that directly address the causes and severity of risks illuminated in Red List assessments. We conclude that RLE could be expanded into a broader holistic spectrum of policy instruments, which could be a key to achieving the ecosystem conservation. © 2019 The Authors.

	abstract = {Assessments of risk to biodiversity often rely on spatial distributions of species and ecosystems. Range-size metrics used extensively in these assessments, such as area of occupancy (AOO), are sensitive to measurement scale, prompting proposals to measure them at finer scales or at different scales based on the shape of the distribution or ecological characteristics of the biota. Despite its dominant role in red-list assessments for decades, appropriate spatial scales of AOO for predicting risks of species’ extinction or ecosystem collapse remain untested and contentious. There are no quantitative evaluations of the scale-sensitivity of AOO as a predictor of risks, the relationship between optimal AOO scale and threat scale, or the effect of grid uncertainty. We used stochastic simulation models to explore risks to ecosystems and species with clustered, dispersed, and linear distribution patterns subject to regimes of threat events with different frequency and spatial extent. Area of occupancy was an accurate predictor of risk (0.81<|r|<0.98) and performed optimally when measured with grid cells 0.1–1.0 times the largest plausible area threatened by an event. Contrary to previous assertions, estimates of AOO at these relatively coarse scales were better predictors of risk than finer-scale estimates of AOO (e.g., when measurement cells are <1% of the area of the largest threat). The optimal scale depended on the spatial scales of threats more than the shape or size of biotic distributions. Although we found appreciable potential for grid-measurement errors, current IUCN guidelines for estimating AOO neutralize geometric uncertainty and incorporate effective scaling procedures for assessing risks posed by landscape-scale threats to species and ecosystems. © 2017 The Authors.

	abstract = {In response to growing demand for ecosystem-level risk assessment in biodiversity conservation, and rapid proliferation of locally tailored protocols, the IUCN recently endorsed new Red List criteria as a global standard for ecosystem risk assessment. Four qualities were sought in the design of the IUCN criteria: generality; precision; realism; and simplicity. Drawing from extensive global consultation, we explore trade-offs among these qualities when dealing with key challenges, including ecosystem classification, measuring ecosystem dynamics, degradation and collapse, and setting decision thresholds to delimit ordinal categories of threat. Experience from countries with national lists of threatened ecosystems demonstrates well-balanced trade-offs in current and potential applications of Red Lists of Ecosystems in legislation, policy, environmental management and education. The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems should be judged by whether it achieves conservation ends and improves natural resource management, whether its limitations are outweighed by its benefits, and whether it performs better than alternative methods. Future development of the Red List of Ecosystems will benefit from the history of the Red List of Threatened Species which was trialed and adjusted iteratively over 50 years from rudimentary beginnings. We anticipate the Red List of Ecosystems will promote policy focus on conservation outcomes in situ across whole landscapes and seascapes. © 2015 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic activities threaten more and more the extension and processes of ecosystems. The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) is a global standard for assessing their risk of collapse. In this paper, global trends of risk assessments of terrestrial and wetland ecosystems were analyzed through a search for and analysis of publications from 2010 to 2019 that utilized the RLE protocols. Forty-three publications that evaluated 1227 ecosystems: forests (531), scrublands (181), grasslands and herbaceous (212), wetlands (166), coastal (42), and sparsely vegetated or uncommon ecosystems (95) were found. Fifteen criteria were recorded to delimit the ecosystems, highlighting the type of vegetation used as a proxy in all cases. There was a strong variation in the extension of the ecosystems evaluated. Thirty-four variables were identified to define collapse thresholds: one spatial, 15 biotics, and 18 abiotics; vegetation cover change, geographic distribution, and extension were variables of general application. The periods of reliable data for assessing ecosystems range from 12 to 48 years; with them, 50-year periods (past or future) or changes deductied since 1750 were inferred. Ecosystems in "Least Concern" (412) stood out, only two "collapsed" were found, and there was no significant difference between threatened and non-threatened. The assessments analyzed comprised 69 countries, which were conducted at continental, national, and subnational scales. Improvements in the RLE protocols are proposed and key information is provided for the application of ecosystems risk assessment in the future. © 2021, Instituto de Ecologia, A.C..

	abstract = {The south west of Western Australia is a global biodiversity hotspot that contains a suite of highly restricted and threatened ecosystems. In common with some other global hotspots, this region has high levels of alpha, beta and gamma diversity characterized by local endemism and spatial turnover of species. The region therefore includes a suite of highly localized species assemblages in complex mosaics across the landscape. Such landscapes pose particular challenges for assessing risks to biodiversity because the status of the most extensive species assemblages within broad scale assessment units tends to mask the status of those that are most restricted. Hence, risk assessments at different thematic scales may sometimes reveal different outcomes and salient threats. We examined these expectations by applying the IUCN Red List criteria for ecosystems at a fine thematic scale to assess risks to shrublands on southern Swan Coastal Plain ironstones, one of the most restricted ecosystems in the region, distinguished by its component suite of endemic flora. The ecosystem was found to be critically endangered due to its declining distribution and restricted current extent in combination with threats, particularly weed invasion. These outcomes suggest two scaling effects when a broader suite of assemblages in the region are considered; the perceived levels of risk may be less extreme; and the main threatening processes that influence risk assessment outcomes rank differently in importance. Both effects are critical to future management to promote persistence of ecosystems, as the priorities and actions will vary between local and regional scales, as will their conservation outcomes. In this case the major needs are to limit vegetation clearing and water extraction and mitigate the invasion of weeds and impacts of disease. The relative emphasis on these strategies varies between local and regional scales. © 2014 Ecological Society of Australia.},

	abstract = {Human-induced habitat clearing and pollution are leading drivers of biodiversity loss. Ecosystem assessments are required to identify ecosystems at risk of collapse, but they should account for cross-system linkages and dynamics where necessary. This is particularly true for coastal wetlands (e.g. seagrass, mangroves and saltmarsh), which exhibit high ecological connectivity and have individually suffered global declines over the last century. We use the coastal wetlands of Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia, as a model system to examine how integrating outcomes of multiple, simultaneously conducted, ecosystem assessments can assist in identifying appropriate management and conservation strategies. We simultaneously conducted separate assessments of seagrass, mangrove and saltmarsh ecosystems against the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems criteria. Despite substantial human population growth in the region, seagrass and mangroves were assessed as Least Concern. Mangroves were found to be rapidly encroaching on saltmarsh. This process, together with past clearing, were the major drivers behind saltmarsh being assessed as Endangered. Given the importance of connectivity among these connected ecosystems, collapse in any one ecosystem can have seascape-wide consequences, highlighting the benefit of conducting multi-ecosystem assessments. Consequently, a fully integrated assessment of the coastal wetlands as a single entity would miss key processes, such as mangrove encroachment, potentially underestimating overall risks. Our study highlights the plight of saltmarsh and the value of conducting simultaneous RLE assessments for multiple ecosystems comprising seascapes. We recommend that connectivity be accounted for explicitly in assessments of other connected, high-risk ecosystems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) assessment is a new powerful scheme that identifies ecosystems that are at risk of collapse due to global environmental changes, which can help any mitigation actions aimed at conserving and rescuing these natural ecosystems. The current study applied RLE assessment protocol on Lake Burullus ecosystem, a highly productive wetland ecosystem, Ramsar site and International Bird Area (IBA) of Egypt. A conceptual model of the key ecosystem processes for Burullus wetland was constructed. The application of RLE followed the standard protocol for the first four criteria; (A) declines in distribution, (B) restricted distribution, (C) degradation of the abiotic components, and (D) regarding the assessment of the disruption of biotic processes and interactions. However, data were insufficient for assessing Criterion (E) that entails conducting quantitative estimates of the risk of collapse. Multi-date satellite images were obtained and processed to estimate the changes in the spatial distribution under criteria (A) and (B) of the study area. For evaluating Criteria (C) and (D), long-term data were collected from literature and previous works to cover the time frame of the assessment as much as possible. The results from the RLE assessment revealed that the status of the ecosystem is Critically Endangered (CR), which was attributed to various types of threats that caused degradation of the natural quality and integrity of the ecosystem. Although the RLE assessment provides a coherent approach for identifying ecosystems vulnerable to human-induced changes; data insufficiency can be an impediment for the efficient application of the RLE assessment. Remotely-sensed data can help in derivation of suitable spectral indicators of the status of the ecosystems structure and functioning that might overcome some of the challenges of data adequacy and relevance to the RLE assessment especially for the understudied and data-deficient ecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Ongoing ecosystem degradation and transformation are major threats to biodiversity. Measuring ecosystem change toward collapse relies on monitoring indicators that quantify key ecological processes. Yet little guidance is available on selection and use of indicators for ecosystem risk assessment. We reviewed indicator use in ecological studies of ecosystem collapse in marine pelagic and temperate forest ecosystems. We examined indicator-selection methods, indicator types (geographic distribution, abiotic, biotic), methods of assessing multiple indicators, and temporal quality of time series. We compared how these factors were applied in the ecological studies with how they were applied in risk assessments by using the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Ecosystems (RLE), for which indicators are used to estimate risk of ecosystem collapse. Ecological studies and RLE assessments rarely reported how indicators were selected, particularly in terrestrial ecosystems. Few ecological studies and RLE assessments quantified ecosystem change based on all 3 indicator types, and indicators types used differed between marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Several studies used indices or multivariate analyses to assess multiple indicators simultaneously, but RLE assessments did not because as RLE guidelines advise against them. Most studies and RLE assessments used time-series data that spanned at least 30 years, which increases the probability of reliably detecting change. Limited use of indicator-selection protocols and infrequent use of all 3 indicator types may hamper accurate detection of change. To improve the value of risk assessments for informing policy and management, we recommend using explicit protocols, including conceptual models, to identify and select indicators; a range of indicators spanning distributional, abiotic, and biotic features; indices and multivariate analyses with extreme care until guidelines are developed; time series with sufficient data to increase ability to accurately diagnose directional change; data from multiple sources to support assessments; and explicitly reporting steps in the assessment process. © 2018 Society for Conservation Biology},

	abstract = {Insights into declines in ecosystem resilience and their causes and effects can inform preemptive action to avoid ecosystem collapse and loss of biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human well-being. Empirical studies of ecosystem collapse are rare and hampered by ecosystem complexity, nonlinear and lagged responses, and interactions across scales. We investigated how an anthropogenic stressor could diminish ecosystem resilience to a recurring perturbation by altering a critical ecosystem driver. We studied groundwater-dependent, peat-accumulating, fire-prone wetlands known as upland swamps in southeastern Australia. We hypothesized that underground mining (stressor) reduces resilience of these wetlands to landscape fires (perturbation) by diminishing groundwater, a key ecosystem driver. We monitored soil moisture as an indicator of ecosystem resilience during and after underground mining. After landscape fire, we compared responses of multiple state variables representing ecosystem structure, composition, and function in swamps within the mining footprint with unmined reference swamps. Soil moisture declined without recovery in swamps with mine subsidence (i.e., undermined), but was maintained in reference swamps over 8 years (effect size 1.8). Relative to burned reference swamps, burned undermined swamps showed greater loss of peat via substrate combustion; reduced cover, height, and biomass of regenerating vegetation; reduced postfire plant species richness and abundance; altered plant species composition; increased mortality rates of woody plants; reduced postfire seedling recruitment; and extirpation of a hydrophilic animal. Undermined swamps therefore showed strong symptoms of postfire ecosystem collapse, whereas reference swamps regenerated vigorously. We found that an anthropogenic stressor diminished the resilience of an ecosystem to recurring perturbations, predisposing it to collapse. Avoidance of ecosystem collapse hinges on early diagnosis of mechanisms and preventative risk reduction. It may be possible to delay or ameliorate symptoms of collapse or to restore resilience, but the latter appears unlikely in our study system due to fundamental alteration of a critical ecosystem driver.

	abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are essential for safeguarding marine biodiversity. Various international and regional agreements require that nations designate sufficient marine areas under protection. Assessing the functionality and coherence of MPA networks is challenging, unless extensive data on species and habitats is available. We evaluated the efficiency of the Finnish MPA network by utilizing a unique dataset of ~140,000 samples, recently collected by the Finnish Inventory Programme for the Underwater Marine Environment, VELMU. Using the quantitative conservation planning and the spatial prioritization method Zonation, we identified sites of high biodiversity and developed a balanced ranking of marine conservation values. Only 27% of the ecologically most valuable features were covered by the current MPA network. Based on the analyses, a set of expansion sites were identified that efficiently complement the ecological and geographical gaps in the current MPA network. Increasing protected sea area by just one percent point, would double the mean conservation cover, and specifically increase the protection levels of habitat types based on IUCN Red List of Ecosystems, key species, threatened species and fish reproduction areas. We also discovered that a large part of ecologically valuable species, such as many brown and red algae, blue mussels and eelgrass, exist in the underwater parts of rocky islands and sandy shores. These areas do not belong to the present (Finnish) interpretation of the habitats (e.g., reefs and underwater sandbanks) listed in the EU Habitats Directive. Neglecting these environments may lead to lack of protection of functionally important biodiversity. We emphasize that, in addition to establishing MPAs, also ecosystem-based marine spatial planning is needed to safeguard the integrity of marine biodiversity in the northern Baltic Sea. The spatial prioritization maps produced in this study are essentially environmental value maps which can also be used in impact avoidance, such as siting of wind energy and aquaculture, or in avoiding overfishing in the most valuable fish areas. Our approach and analytical procedure can be replicated in the Baltic Sea or elsewhere provided that sufficient data exist. © 2018 Virtanen, Viitasalo, Lappalainen and Moilanen.},

	abstract = {Global warming is rapidly emerging as a universal threat to ecological integrity and function, highlighting the urgent need for a better understanding of the impact of heat exposure on the resilience of ecosystems and the people who depend on them 1. Here we show that in the aftermath of the record-breaking marine heatwave on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016 2, corals began to die immediately on reefs where the accumulated heat exposure exceeded a critical threshold of degree heating weeks, which was 3-4 °C-weeks. After eight months, an exposure of 6 °C-weeks or more drove an unprecedented, regional-scale shift in the composition of coral assemblages, reflecting markedly divergent responses to heat stress by different taxa. Fast-growing staghorn and tabular corals suffered a catastrophic die-off, transforming the three-dimensionality and ecological functioning of 29% of the 3,863 reefs comprising the world's largest coral reef system. Our study bridges the gap between the theory and practice of assessing the risk of ecosystem collapse, under the emerging framework for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Ecosystems 3, by rigorously defining both the initial and collapsed states, identifying the major driver of change, and establishing quantitative collapse thresholds. The increasing prevalence of post-bleaching mass mortality of corals represents a radical shift in the disturbance regimes of tropical reefs, both adding to and far exceeding the influence of recurrent cyclones and other local pulse events, presenting a fundamental challenge to the long-term future of these iconic ecosystems. © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

South Africa's ecosystem threat status indicator was conceptualised in the early 2000s and progressed from a project-based indicator to listing of threatened ecosystems in terms of national legislation in 2011. We show the range of applications of the indicator, from its use as a headline indicator in the National Biodiversity Assessment to its role as a direct trigger for Environmental Impact Assessment. The strong link between threatened ecosystems and systematic conservation planning in South Africa also enabled ecosystem threat status to inform multi-sectoral development planning and decision-making. We show how bridging products, data availability, persistent mainstreaming and stakeholder engagement have encouraged the use of the indicator in government policy. The advantages and disadvantages of legislative listing are shared. Sound scientific foundations, combined with pragmatism, have provided a policy-relevant tool for focussing management on threatened ecosystems. We make active recommendations that will facilitate the policy uptake of the IUCN RLE in other countries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Although such efforts have achieved significant gains, there are undeniable limitations to this speciesbased approach. Here, we introduce the concept of "endangered ecosystems" (i.e., endangered spaces), which promotes the conservation of whole ecosystems and, thereby, the organisms that are inseparable from them. This ecosystem approach is important as a basis for conserving nature in a comprehensive way. An increasing number of conservation projects apply this concept in practice. In reviewing 22 examples from the red lists of ecosystems, landforms, and communities, we found 10 major features of endangered ecosystems: decreasing in area; intrinsically rare; declining ecological processes and function; associated with significant fragmentation; facing major threats from development; having high species diversity; providing good habitat for rare and endangered species; having a large, intact wilderness area; representative of a geographic region; and having high cultural and aesthetic values. The concept of endangered ecosystems is expected to overcome the limitations of the species-byspecies conservation approach. In addition, it would assist in the preservation of ecosystems that lack protection from traditional legislative means; promote scientific research into ecological processes and functions; and motivate engagement among land managers, researchers, and public stakeholders to accelerate conservation planning in geographic regions.},

However, misconceptions of the Red List assessment process, along with its technically demanding nature, can result in the misapplication of their criteria, leading to inconsistent and potentially unreliable assessments. To address this problem, we developed redlistr, an R package aiding in the production of consistent species and ecosystem Red List assessments. Redlistr's features include methods to calculate 1) area from spatial data, 2) range size metrics, 3) rates of change of distributions or populations, and 4) distribution or population at another time from these rates. A key feature of the package is the systematic approach used to eliminate geometric uncertainty when estimating area of occupancy. Here, we develop two case studies to demonstrate the functionalities of redlistr with typical workflows for both species and ecosystems. Redlistr was developed to be accessible to users with a broad range of experience in programming for spatial and temporal data analysis, and sufficiently flexible to allow users to parameterise functions and select equations to fit their purposes. The package specifically aims to assist researchers and conservation practitioners to conduct robust and transparent risk assessments of ecosystems and species under the IUCN Red List criteria but is also useful for other studies requiring analyses of range size, area change and calculations of rates of change. © 2018 The Authors},

	abstract = {The first European Red List of habitats is released by a large project involving over 150 experts from 33 countries (Janssen et al. 2016). In this article an overview of the project methodology and results on mire habitats is presented with special reference to Finnish mires. Altogether 13 treeless mire habitats were assessed, of which 10 occur in Finland. The typology applied in the assessment was a compromise and individual habitat types were relatively broadly defined. Names of habitat types include terms from various research traditions and conventions and should not be strictly interpreted without careful account on the habitat descriptions. Importantly, all habitat types grossly conform to vegetation types and not to mire complexes. The assessments were largely based on the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems approach (Keith et al. 2013). In the European scale, mires were the most threatened habitat group, as 11 habitats (85%) were assessed as threatened (Vulnerable, Endangered, Critically Endangered). The most commonly used criterion was decrease of habitat area during recent past 50 years (criterion A1). Palsa mires were assessed as critically endangered (CR) by the quantitative Ecriterion, predicting the probability of collapse of the habitat type to be over 50% during the next 50 years. The total area of mire habitats reported in EU28 countries was 8.91 million ha and the recent past area was 12.85 million ha. Total mire habitat area in Finland was 1.77 million ha and recent past estimate was 2.75 million ha. Often much higher total area is denoted for Finnish mires but such accounts always include mire woodlands that are counted as forests in most other countries and also in the European habitat assessment. The Red List of European habitats gives a valuable overview of European mire habitats; their extent, recent changes, threats and status. In addition to this overview, regional assessments are needed, because very different situations prevail in different parts of Europe and because the compromised typology does not provide enough detail to identify important regional variation among mires. © 2017 Suoseura - Finnish Peatland Society.},

	abstract = {During the last decade, the IUCN has developed criteria analogous to the Red List of Threatened Species to perform similar risk assessment on ecosystems, creating the Red List of Ecosystems methodology. One of the most significant challenges for the construction of these lists is the gathering and availability of the information needed to apply the criteria. We present a complement to the IUCN's methodology to assess the threat level to ecosystems, estimating the spatial and temporal quality of the information available in scientific publications. We did this by applying the IUCN criteria to determine the threat level to the sclerophyll ecosystems of central Chile. Spatially explicit studies that identify disturbances in the structure of the vegetation were selected, making it possible to quantify effectively the reduction in the ecosystems’ distribution. The spatial and temporal quality of the assessment were estimated as the percentage of the potential ecosystem distribution and the time frame recommended by the IUCN (50 years), that the studies represented for each ecosystem. The application of the methodology allowed the assessment of a high percentage of the ecosystems (85%), which were classified based on the studies with ranges of temporal quality from 30 to 100% and spatial quality from 12 to 100%. If only the assessments with more than medium spatio-temporal quality are considered (> 50%), eight of the 17 evaluated ecosystems are classified in threat categories, which represents 22.9% of the study area. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

However, the origin and collapse status of the criterion is vague for assessors, and the results are inconsistent as the response of ecosystems to environment are different. Therefore, the ecological amplitude of ecosystem to environment stress was introduced in the ecosystems risk assessment with the relationship between criterion and ecological amplitude. To put this concept into practice, remote sensing was applied to acquire the optimum and tolerance of each ecosystem. The natural forest in xishuangbanna was assessed by this proposed method to identify the stress of temperature. The result show that the status of natural forest in the past is least concern (LC), and vulnerable (VU) in the feature. With temperature in the future significantly increasing, natural forest may be suffered with heat stress. The proposed method describe the risk derived from degradation of environment in mechanism greatly improved the consistency and feasibility of Criterion C in the ecosystems risk assessment. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Developing a standardized approach to measuring the state of biodiversity in landscapes undergoing disturbance is crucial for evaluating and comparing change across different systems, assessing ecosystem vulnerability and the impacts of destructive activities, and helping direct species recovery actions. Existing ecosystem metrics of condition fail to acknowledge that a particular community could be in multiple states, and the distribution of states could worsen or improve when impacted by a disturbance process, depending on how far the current landscape distribution of states diverges from pre-anthropogenic impact baseline conditions. We propose a way of rapidly assessing regional-scale condition in ecosystems where the distribution of age classes representing increasing time since last disturbance is suspected to have diverged from an ideal benchmark reference distribution. We develop two metrics that (1) compare the observed mean time since last disturbance with an expected mean and (2) quantify the summed shortfall of vegetation age-class frequencies relative to a reference age-class distribution of time since last disturbance. We demonstrate the condition metrics using two case studies: (1) fire in threatened southwestern Australian proteaceaous mallee-heath and (2) impacts of disturbance (fire and logging) in the critically endangered southeastern Australian mountain ash Eucalyptus regnans forest on the yellow-bellied glider Petaurus australis. We explore the effects of uncertainty in benchmark time since last disturbance, and evaluate metric sensitivity using simulated age-class distributions representing alternative ecosystems. By accounting for and penalizing too-frequent and too-rare disturbances, the summed shortfall metric is more sensitive to change than mean time since last disturbance. We find that mountain ash forest is in much poorer condition (summed shortfall 38.5 out of 100 for a 120-yr benchmark disturbance interval) than indicated merely by loss of extent (84% of vegetation remaining). Proteaceaous mallee-heath is in worse condition than indicated by loss of extent for an upper benchmark interval of 80 yr, but condition almost doubles for the minimum tolerable time since last disturbance interval of 20 yr. To fully describe ecosystem degradation, we recommend that our summed shortfall metric, focused on habitat quality and informed by biologically meaningful baselines, be added to existing condition measures focused on vegetation extent. This will improve evaluation of change in ecosystem states and enhance management of ecosystems in poor condition. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America},

	abstract = {Recent assessments of progress towards global conservation targets have revealed a paucity of indicators suitable for assessing the changing state of ecosystems. Moreover, land managers and planners are often unable to gain timely access to the maps they need to support their routine decision-making. This deficiency is partly due to a lack of suitable data on ecosystem change, driven mostly by the considerable technical expertise needed to develop ecosystem maps from remote sensing data. We have developed a free and open-access online remote sensing and environmental modelling application, the Remote Ecosystem Monitoring and Assessment Pipeline (Remap; https://remap-app.org), that enables volunteers, managers and scientists with little or no experience in remote sensing to generate classifications (maps) of land cover and land use change over time. Remap utilizes the geospatial data storage and analysis capacity of Google Earth Engine and requires only spatially resolved training data that define map classes of interest (e.g. ecosystem types). The training data, which can be uploaded or annotated interactively within Remap, are used in a random forest classification of up to 13 publicly available predictor datasets to assign all pixels in a focal region to map classes. Predictor datasets available in Remap represent topographic (e.g. slope, elevation), spectral (archival Landsat image composites) and climatic variables (precipitation, temperature) that are relevant to the distribution of ecosystems and land cover classes. The ability of Remap to develop and export high-quality classified maps in a very short (<10 min) time frame represents a considerable advance towards globally accessible and free application of remote sensing technology. By enabling access to data and simplifying remote sensing classifications, Remap can catalyse the monitoring of land use and change to support environmental conservation, including developing inventories of biodiversity, identifying hotspots of ecosystem diversity, ecosystem-based spatial conservation planning, mapping ecosystem loss at local scales and supporting environmental education initiatives. © 2018 The Authors.

Densities of B. hilaris in the dried lake reached 628.88 ± 95.28 ind/m2 and the infested area amounted to 310 ha, representing 26% of the total lake area. The population of B. hilaris in the dried Aculeo Lake reached 1948.9 ± 295.3 million individuals.

To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we systematically review evidence for ecosystem collapses reported in two contrasting biomes – marine pelagic ecosystems and terrestrial forests. Most studies define states of ecosystem collapse quantitatively, but few studies adequately describe initial ecosystem states or ecological transitions leading to collapse. On the basis of our review, we offer four recommendations for defining ecosystem collapse in risk assessments: (1) qualitatively defining initial and collapsed states, (2) describing collapse and recovery transitions, (3) identifying and selecting indicators of collapse, and (4) setting quantitative collapse thresholds. © The Ecological Society of America},

	abstract = {Neotropical dry forests are among the most diverse and threatened ecosystems worldwide. The extent and knowledge of Neotropical dry forests are quite heterogeneous with forests located in the Ecuadorian province especially diverse, threatened and poorly studied. In this work, we review patterns and conservation status of biodiversity, ecosystem processes and human perception of tropical dry forest of the Ecuadorian province. We found that patterns of biodiversity, endemism and conservation status are generally poorly studied. Overall, these forests provide habitat for at least 900 species including trees, birds, mammals, amphibians and reptiles. On average 18% of these species (range 6–25%) are endemic to the region and 25% (3–50%) are recognized as threatened. Little is known about groups such as invertebrates, fish, fungi, or herbaceous plants, and as well as about processes generating and maintaining critical ecosystem functions. Available literature points out the importance of positive ecological interactions such us plant–frugivore and plant–plant facilitation interactions in maintaining the regeneration dynamics of these forests. Faced by the formative state of knowledge about basic biodiversity patterns and ecological functions, the implementation of ecosystem risk assessment under the IUCN criteria for the Red List of Ecosystems may offer constructive means to organize, integrate and advance existing knowledge and conservation priorities for dry forests of the Ecuadorian province. With examples of existing conflicts between people and protected areas, we emphasize the importance of consultation and involvement of local communities in the development of conservation measures including new protected areas. Lastly, we reflect on some encouraging examples where ecosystem goods and services provided by these forests may be used in a sustainable manner, contributing to local communities’ income and preserving biodiversity. In this regard, we highlight how the interaction between research and innovation together with local management may lead to sustainable development and, thus, encourage these sectors to work together for the conservation of dry forests of the Ecuadorian province. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has produced biodiversity and conservation knowledge products that are fundamental for tracking the progress of targets such as the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. We examined if countries in the Americas are using knowledge products based on IUCN standards to help construct their documents; 234 documents were analyzed for knowledge product keywords. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species was mentioned in 91.8% of keyword-coded segments. IUCN publications, Protected Areas Categories, Key Biodiversity Areas, the Red List of Ecosystems and World Database on Protected Areas had 8.2% of the remaining segments.

	abstract = {Ecosystems worldwide are under increasing threat. We applied a standardized method for assessing the risk of ecosystem collapse, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Ecosystems, to coral reefs in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO), covering 11,919 km2 of reef (~5% of the global total). Our approach combined indicators of change in historic ecosystem extent, ecosystem functioning (hard corals, fleshy algae, herbivores and piscivores) and projected sea temperature warming. We show that WIO coral reefs are vulnerable to collapse at the regional level, while in 11 nested ecoregions they range from critically endangered (islands, driven by future warming) to vulnerable (continental coast and northern Seychelles, driven principally by fishing pressure). Responses to avoid coral reef collapse must include ecosystem-based management of reefs and adjacent systems combined with mitigating and adapting to climate change. Our approach can be replicated across coral reefs globally to help countries and other actors meet conservation and sustainability targets set under multiple global conventions—including the Convention on Biological Diversity’s post-2020 global biodiversity framework and the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {Complex socio-ecological problems typically involve a variety of stakeholders, with viewpoints that may range between consensus and deep disagreement over values and judgments. Understanding this distribution of opinion is key to finding conservation solutions. We examine how stakeholders with widely different backgrounds vary in their judgments of rangeland degradation in Mongolia's Gobi Desert, where grazing intensity is a contested issue. We gathered the judgments of 92 stakeholders from a highly diverse group including: (i) nomadic pastoralists (herders), (ii) experts in botany, (iii) experts in wildlife ecology, and (iv) conservation policy practitioners. These stakeholders considered degradation in five ecosystems including Desert shrublands, Steppe, and Siberian Elm riparian woodlands, using written site descriptions in a workshop context. Each stakeholder considered degradation using two conceptual frameworks: the notion of “ecosystem collapse” described by the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems and the concept of ecological condition. We used generalized additive models (GAMs) to examine the relationship between vegetation attributes and stakeholder judgments of condition. Although individual stakeholder varied in their judgments, we found only relatively small systematic variations between different types of stakeholders. Similarly, we found the degree of specialization of experts had little effect on the condition score. We also used GAMs to examine the relationship between vegetation attributes and stakeholder judgments of collapse, finding little variation between groups. We also explored the threshold of overall vegetation cover where stakeholders are likely to shift their judgment from collapsed to not collapsed, and while differences between ecosystems were observed, we found consensus between the different stakeholder groups within each ecosystem. Our results suggest that, at least in the context of the Southern Mongolia, diverse stakeholder groups have convergent views in respect to ecological degradation. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {Important sources of information in the field of nature protection are red lists, which define the degree of threat to individual species. In practice, an assessment of the quality of the habitats in which a species occurs is used to a very limited extent in the preparation of red lists of vascular plants. At the same time, this parameter is usually essential to determine their degree of threat. At present, habitat quality data are available for the territory of the Czech Republic; these were obtained during Natura 2000 habitat mapping in the years 2000–2019. In this paper we propose the use of habitat quality data to determine the degree of threat to selected species of vascular plants and to compile a national red list. Nine plant species from three habitat types were selected for this study: meadows and wetland habitats in the alluvium of large rivers (Cardamine matthioli Moretti, Gratiola officinalis L., Teucrium scordium L.), fen habitats (Carex appropinquata Schumach., C. cespitosa L., C. lepidocarpa Tausch) and ecotone shrub habitats (Rosa agrestis Savi, R. micrantha Borrer ex Sm., R. spinosissima L.). For these species, the quality of the habitats in which they occur was analysed and grid maps were created, which present (1) the level of knowledge of habitat quality and (2) the average habitat quality. The results were compared with the degree of threat in the current national red list. Habitat quality analysis should also be used in the future to detect threatened species, which today are outside the red list and this assessment may be useful in compiling another updated red list of vascular plants of the Czech Republic. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Knowledge products comprise assessments of authoritative information supported by standards, governance, quality control, data, tools, and capacity building mechanisms. Considerable resources are dedicated to developing and maintaining knowledge products for biodiversity conservation, and they are widely used to inform policy and advise decision makers and practitioners. However, the financial cost of delivering this information is largely undocumented. We evaluated the costs and funding sources for developing and maintaining four global biodiversity and conservation knowledge products: The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems, Protected Planet, and the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas. These are secondary data sets, built on primary data collected by extensive networks of expert contributors worldwide. We estimate that US$160 million (range: US$116-204 million), plus 293 person-years of volunteer time (range: 278- 308 person-years) valued at US$ 14 million (range US$12-16 million), were invested in these four knowledge products between 1979 and 2013. More than half of this financing was provided through philanthropy, and nearly three-quarters was spent on personnel costs. The estimated annual cost of maintaining data and platforms for three of these knowledge products (excluding the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems for which annual costs were not possible to estimate for 2013) is US$6.5 million in total (range: US$6.2-6.7 million).We estimated that an additional US$114 million will be needed to reach pre-defined baselines of data coverage for all the four knowledge products, and that once achieved, annual maintenance costs will be approximately US$12 million. These costs are much lower than those to maintain many other, similarly important, global knowledge products. Ensuring that biodiversity and conservation knowledge products are sufficiently up to date, comprehensive and accurate is fundamental to inform decision-making for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development. Thus, the development and implementation of plans for sustainable long-Term financing for them is critical. © 2016 Adel et al.

We applied a systematic RLE assessment to 456 terrestrial ecosystems in South Africa between 2017 and 2021. What sets South Africa apart in this endeavour is that an independently formulated ecosystem threat status indicator was devel-oped between 2004 and 2008 and the list of threatened ecosystems (effectively a proto RLE) was integrated into the national environmental regulatory framework in 2011. Through this, Critically Endangered and Endangered types were afforded a form of statutory protection through increased regulation of land-use change activities. We describe the transition to the IUCN RLE framework and focus on both the technical steps of incorporating the best available data into a credible assessment, and the unique social and legal processes to ensure that the biodiversity conservation sector in South Africa understood and supported the proposed replacement of the existing list of threatened ecosystems (2011) with the RLE (2021). We discuss the policy development steps required in South Africa, and the pros and cons of maintaining a legislative link for RLE implementation. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {World ecosystems are suffering great losses from anthropogenic and natural pressures. To meet the demand of ecosystem-level risk assessment for biodiversity conservation, the IUCN has adopted a global standard to assess the risk to ecosystems. The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (IUCN RLE) is a growing tool to raise the public awareness of ecosystem conservation and provide reasonable strategies to managers. As for managing ecosystems with the RLE, the spatial information of degraded patches is important for the efficient allocation of conservation resources. In this paper, a method for assessment across hierarchy of spatial domains was designed to provide spatial information for the IUCN RLE. 105 natural ecosystems of vegetation in Southwestern China were systematically assessed at the hierarchy of spatial domains. According to the results, the declining distributions of most ecosystems have slowed down recently due to protection policies. All vegetative ecosystems containing nationally protected species are threatened, supporting the robustness of this protocol. Limited distributions and degradation in area are the key risk to threatened ecosystems, as threatened ecosystems account for only 1.55% of the total area and the mean of its degradation in area is almost 45%. With the assessment in the hierarchy of spatial domains, the IUCN RLE was featured with spatial information of degraded patches. The hierarchical assessment markedly improved the practical applications of RLE and led to an efficient allocation of conservation resources. The scale effect of hierarchical assessment was significant and the representativeness of ecosystems in systematic assessments is extremely valuable. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

We employed Geographical Information Systems and remote sensing to process the obtained satellite products from the years 2000 to 2015, and generated indicators for biological processes and degradation of environment with boreal ecosystem productivity simulator. The results show that all twelve ecosystems in the Xilin River Basin confront varying threats: Artemisia frigida grassland and Festuca ovina grassland face the highest risk of collapse, sharing an endangered status; Filifolium sibiricum meadow grassland and Leymus chinensis grassland have a least concern status, while the remaining eight ecosystems display a vulnerable status.

	abstract = {Itigi thicket is a spatially restricted ecosystem only present in Zambia and Tanzania. It is thought to be highly threatened and therefore we need to urgently assess the threats to this ecosystem as well as extent and rates of change to derive its true conservation status. In this study we focus on the Itigi-Sumbu thicket surrounding Lake Mweru Wantipa in Zambia, which occurs both inside and outside a National Park (IUCN category II). Earth observation data archives provide the means to assist the conservation assessment process by allowing the monitoring of the ecosystem over time. In particular, the Landsat archive offers over 40 years of imagery at a resolution suited to the distribution of this ecosystem. In this study we exploit this archive and extend it back 50 years using historical aerial photography. The remote-sensing data were classified according to presence of thicket at five dates across a 50-year period and these outputs were combined to produce a deforestation map. Crucially, this map was assessed for accuracy using a novel approach to expert knowledge, which shows that the resultant map is highly accurate (93% overall accuracy). A confusion matrix was used to provide a confidence interval to the deforestation figures.

	abstract = {Springs are ecosystems influenced by the exposure of groundwater at the Earth’s surface. Springs are abundant and have played important, highly interactive ecological, cultural, and socio-economic roles in arid, mesic, and subaqueous environments throughout human evolution and history. However, springs also are widely regarded as being highly threatened by human impacts. Cantonati et al. (2020a) recommended increased global awareness of springs, including basic mapping, inventory and assessment of the distribution and ecological integrity of springs. We conducted a preliminary global analysis on the ecological integrity of springs by reviewing information on the distribution, ecohydrogeology, associated species, kinds and intensity of human uses, and level of ecological impairment of spring ecosystems. We reviewed information on an estimated 250,000 spring ecosystems among 78 countries across much of the world. Available literature on spring ecological integrity is sparse, widely scattered, and spatially erratic, with major gaps in knowledge. We report large differences in the quality and extent of information among countries and continents, with only moderate data availability even among developed countries, and limited information across most of the developing world. Among countries with available data, ecological impairment of springs is everywhere rampant, sometimes exceeding 90% in developed regions. Impairment among Holarctic nations is generally negatively related to distance from human development, elevation, and latitude, but such patterns are less evident in Africa, Australia, and South America. Declining trends in ecosystem condition, compounding threat factors, and spring-dependent population declines, extirpation, and extinctions of plants, invertebrates, fish, and herpetofauna are widely reported. Overall, available information indicates a global crisis in spring ecosystem integrity, with levels of ecosystem impairment ranging from Vulnerable to fully Collapsed. The threats to aquifers and the ecological integrity of springs vary spatially. Many springs are impaired by local impacts due to flow diversion, geomorphic alteration, land use practices, recreation impacts, and the introduction of non-native species. These threats can be reduced through education, rehabilitation of geomorphology and habitat quality, and species reintroductions if the supporting aquifer remains relatively intact. However, springs also are widely threatened by regional to global factors, including groundwater extraction and pollution, as well as climate change. Such coarse-scale, pre-emergence impacts negatively affect the sustainability of spring ecosystems and the aquifers that support them. Improving understanding and stewardship of springs will require much additional systematic inventory and assessment, improved information management, and reconsideration of basic conservation concepts (e.g., habitat connectivity), as well as cultural and socio-economic valuation. Substantial societal recognition, discussion, and policy reform are needed within and among nations to better protect and sustainably rehabilitate springs, their supporting aquifers, and the spring-dependent human and biotic populations that depend upon them. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The Red List of Ecosystems is a growing toolbox for assessing risks to biodiversity at the ecosystem level, which is complementary to the Red List of Threatened Species and important for the protection of key species’ habitats. The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Criteria was adopted as an official global standard for assessing the risks to ecosystems by the IUCN Council. With the revision and extension of the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Criteria, this framework is gradually improved, which plays an important role in biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management. However, it faces challenges in ecosystem mapping, the concepts of ecosystem collapse and practical application. This paper reviews the development of the Red List of Ecosystems and introduces the five criterions in the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems protocol (declining in distribution, restricted distribution, abiotic degradation, biotic degradation and quantitative estimates of risk of ecosystem collapse) and how it is used. While focusing on the challenges in the assessment with the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Criteria, we also discuss the potential solutions to these problems based on remote sensing and ecological models. We points out that the explicit definition of ecosystem collapse and the classification system of ecosystems is essential for applying the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Criteria; the scale effects have great impacts on the results of assessment; assessment at hierarchical scales may be a potential method to provide spatial information for the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems; incorporating remote sensing and ecological models into this framework is an important way to study the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Criteria in the near future. © 2017, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Three fusion strategies were contained in the proposed approach: hard matching, buffer matching and merged categories matching. Meanwhile, the related spatial distribution knowledge and the law of spatial distance decay were used to determine the optimal vegetation type, when more than two vegetation types are matched simultaneously. Taking the Southwestern China as study area, a new 30m-resolution ecosystem map with 144 ecosystem types was generated by the proposed method, which was used to establish the red list of ecosystems and evaluate the condition of biodiversity in the White Paper: China's Biodiversity. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Drivers of biodiversity loss have generated an increased risk of ecosystem collapse in the Anthropocene. Coral ecosystems are among the most diverse ecosystems, but at the same time also part of the most vulnerable and threatened ecosystems worldwide. This is the case of Wider and Colombian Caribbean coral ecosystems, which has a reduction of 50%, with extreme cases of 85% of their cover over the past decades. The methodology of the Red List of Ecosystems was implemented, for the first time, on the Colombian Caribbean to provide the assessment of collapse risk for coral ecosystems. To do this, the spatial and functional components of the ecosystem were analyzed using two of the Red List criteria (B and D) at three spatial scales (national, ecoregional, and biotic). For the former component, restricted distribution metrics were applied, and monitoring data of 20-year period (SIMAC) were used for the latter. Also, as a novel issue in coral functional risk assessment, macroalgae cover was considered, along with the percentage of live coral cover. The results indicated differences in the level of collapse risk depending on the spatial scale, whereby the national scale hid the most important risk dynamics of ecoregions and biotic scale overestimated the spatial risk. However, all ecosystem units at the three scales were assess from vulnerable to critically endangered, which means high-risk categories. Functional spatio-temporal analysis showed a general high-risk stability for the two variables chosen (fleshy algae cover and live corals) since 1998. These were complementary and necessary to propose the hypothesis of phase shift in the Colombian oceanic region, the area with the highest functional risk in the Colombian Caribbean. Finally, practical management recommendations were made based on the final assessment proposed by the risk map of coral ecosystems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Assessing risks to marine ecosystems is critical due to their biological and economic importance, and because many have recently undergone regime shifts due to overfishing and environmental change. Yet defining collapsed ecosystem states, selecting informative indicators and reconstructing long-term marine ecosystem changes remains challenging. The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems constitutes the global standard for quantifying risks to ecosystems and we conducted the first Red List assessment of an offshore marine ecosystem, focusing on the southern Benguela in South Africa. We used an analogous but collapsed ecosystem – the northern Benguela – to help define collapse in the southern Benguela and derived collapse thresholds with structured expert elicitation (i.e. repeatable estimation by expert judgment). To capture complex ecosystem dynamics and reconstruct historical ecosystem states, we used environmental indicators as well as survey-, catch- and model-based indicators. We listed the ecosystem in 1960 and 2015 as Endangered, with assessment outcomes robust to alternative model parametrizations. While many indicators improved between 1960 and 2015, seabird populations have suffered large declines since 1900 and remain at risk, pointing towards ongoing management priorities. Catch-based indicators often over-estimated risks compared to survey- and model-based indicators, warning against listing ecosystems as threatened solely based on indicators of pressure. We show that risk assessments provide a framework for interpreting data from indicators, ecosystem models and experts to inform the management of marine ecosystems. This work highlights the feasibility of conducting Red List of Ecosystems assessments for marine ecosystems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

We developed both potential and current distribution maps of terrestrial ecosystem types for the temperate and tropical Americas; with "potential"estimating where a type would likely occur today had there not been prior land conversion for modern land uses. We utilized a hierarchical classification to describe and map natural ecosystem types at six levels of thematic detail, with lower thematic levels defining more units each with narrower floristic range than upper levels. Current land use/ land cover was derived using available global data on human land use intensity and combined with the potential distribution maps to estimate long-Term change in extent for each ecosystem type. We also assessed representation of ecosystem types within protected areas as defined by IUCN I-VI land status categories. Of the 749 ecosystem types assessed, represented at 5th (n = 315) vs. 6th (n = 433) levels of the classification hierarchy, 5 types (1.6%) and 31 types (7.1%), respectively, have lost 90% of their potential extent. Some 66 types (20.9%) and 141 types (32.5%), respectively, have lost 50% of their potential extent; thus, crossing thresholds of Vulnerable status under IUCN Red List criterion A3. For ecosystem type representation within IUCN protected area classes, with reference to potential extent of each type, 111 (45.3%) and 125 (28.8%) of types, respectively, have higher representation (17%) than CBD 2020 targets. Twelve types (3.8%) and 23 (5.3%) of types, respectively, are represented with 1% within protected areas. We illustrate an option for visualizing and reporting on CBD targets (2020 and proposed post-2020) for ecosystem representativeness using both potential extent as a baseline. © 2020 Comer et al.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem conservation is important for biodiversity and for human well-being. Understanding the relative risks to ecosystems is fundamental to well-informed ecosystem management. The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems protocol provides an adaptable framework for risk assessment across terrestrial, subterranean, freshwater and marine ecosystems. I review a series of detailed case studies, published in this special edition of AustralEcology, that apply the Red List of Ecosystems criteria to a broad range of ecosystem types. These studies show that detailed risk assessments are especially valuable as forerunners to strategic ecosystem management. Key components of Red List assessments that contribute to development of management strategies include critical diagnosis of trends and their causes, identification of dependencies that influence ecosystem responses to environmental change and selection of ecosystem-specific diagnostic variables that can be useful monitoring tools for evaluating the performance of management. Ecosystem Red List assessments are crucial to regulatory processes under environmental legislation in Australia and other countries. The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem criteria will help improve the scientific rigour of statutory listings and could also provide a unifying framework for the suite of listing processes that differ among jurisdictions for historical reasons. When integrated with a comprehensive ecosystem typology, ecosystem Red List assessments can also provide critical input into systematic conservation planning. The case studies demonstrate a range of analytical approaches to risk assessment framed to accommodate data of varying quality and abundance. I conclude by exploring opportunities and requirements for a systematic continental-scale Red List assessment of Australian ecosystems. © 2015 The Authors.

	abstract = {Aim: Megafire events generate immediate concern for wildlife and human well-being, but their broader ecological impacts likely extend beyond individual species and single fire events. In the first mechanistic study of fire effects focussed on ecosystems, we aimed to assess the sensitivity and exposure of ecosystems to multiple fire-related threats, placing impacts in the context of changing fire regimes and their interactions with other threats. Location: Southern and eastern Australia. Time period: 2019–2020. Major species studied: Australian ecosystems. Methods: We defined 15 fire-related threats to ecosystems based on mechanisms associated with: (a) direct effects of fire regime components; (b) interactions between fire and physical environmental processes; (c) effects of fire on biological interactions; and (d) interactions between fire and human activity. We estimated the sensitivity and exposure of a sample of 92 ecosystem types to each threat type based on published relationships and spatial analysis of the 2019–2020 fires. Results: Twenty-nine ecosystem types assessed had more than half of their distribution exposed to one or more threat types, and only three of those were listed as nationally threatened. Three fire-related threat types posed the most severe threats to large numbers of ecosystem types: high frequency fire; pre-fire drought; and post-fire invasive predator activity. The ecosystem types most affected ranged from rain forests to peatlands, and included some, such as sclerophyllous eucalypt forests and heathlands, that are traditionally regarded as fire-prone and fire-adapted. Main conclusions: Most impacts of the 2019–2020 fires on ecosystems became apparent only when they were placed in the context of the whole fire regime and its interactions with other threatening processes, and were not direct consequences of the megafire event itself. Our mechanistic approach enables ecosystem-specific management responses for the most threatened ecosystem types to be targeted at underlying causes of degradation and decline. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) is an emerging global standard for ecosystem risk assessment that integrates data and knowledge to document the relative risk status of ecosystem types. Here we summarize initial findings from the applying IUCN criteria to 107 grassland and savanna ecosystems in temperate North America. Determining threatened status first requires type description and mapping. Then, a series of measures are applied addressing trends in ecosystem extent, the relative restricted nature of its distribution, and the relative severity of environmental degradation and disruption of biotic processes. All measures aim to gauge the probability of range wide collapse. Ecosystems may be scored as collapsed, critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable, near threatened, least concern, data deficient, or not evaluated. From this analysis, and taking uncertainty into account, 67 (63%) of grassland and savanna ecosystem types scored as threatened (i.e., either critically endangered (25%), endangered (14%), or vulnerable (24%)). Examples of threatened ecosystems include Midwestern tallgrass prairies and oak savannas, Pine barrens of the Northeast, California Central Valley grasslands and oak savannas, Palouse prairie, savannas and wet prairies of Washington and Oregon, Southeastern glades and barrens, and Florida dry prairie and inland scrub. These ecosystems historically occupied about 2.5 million km2 of North America but today account for only 834,000km2, a loss of two-thirds of historical extent. Those listed in the most severely threatened categories of critically endangered or endangered today account for about 110,000km2 or an 88% loss of their historical extent of about 930,000km2. This result reflects conditions at temperate latitudes where, such as in the United States and Canada, advanced industrial economies have actively transformed ecosystems over recent centuries. The RLE provides governments with a means to prioritize conservation effort and for researchers to advance knowledge critical to natural resource conservation assessment, planning, management, and monitoring. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Both of these approaches consider conservation status in terms of the risk of ecosystem collapse. However, the scientific understanding of ecosystem collapse is still at a relatively early stage. Consequently, concerns have been raised regarding the scientific basis of ecosystem conservation assessments focusing on collapse risk. Here I explore how these concerns might potentially be addressed by considering how the concept is defined, and by briefly reviewing the theoretical basis of ecosystem collapse. I then examine the implications of recent research results for the design of ecosystem collapse risk assessments, and the challenges identified in those assessments conducted to date. Recommendations are made regarding how collapse risk assessments might be strengthened based on current scientific understanding, and how this understanding could be improved by further research. In addition, I examine the potential implications for conservation policy and practice if the scientific basis of collapse risk assessments is not strengthened in this way. © 2021 by the author.

	abstract = {Habitat loss and habitat fragmentation are amongst the major drivers of biodiversity loss globally. Although habitat fragmentation poses additional threats to biodiversity beyond habitat loss alone, the IUCN’s Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) does not provide guidance on how to assess these threats. This study develops an approach for incorporating habitat fragmentation into the RLE threat assessment and investigates additional insights such an analysis could provide beyond the analysis of distribution trends. This is achieved by quantifying RLE criteria A and B (distribution reduction, restricted distribution and decline) and comparing outcomes with indices of habitat fragmentation (core area, Largest Patch Index, Patch Cohesion Index and Aggregation Index) in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. Results revealed that much of the Cape Floristic Region is severely threatened by both landscape transformation and habitat fragmentation, but that treating the habitat fragmentation indices as additional RLE criteria did not alter the ecosystem threat assessment outcomes. Whilst this suggests that the existing RLE criteria implicitly account for habitat fragmentation, the relationship between fragmentation indices and RLE criteria were weak and highly variable in some cases, indicating that the RLE criteria alone do not sufficiently account for the threat of habitat fragmentation. Supplementing the RLE with habitat fragmentation measures highlights additional, unique information on threats to ecosystems. This simple approach has the potential to assist in setting conservation priorities and management goals, particularly in fragmented ecosystems. © 2021 Ecological Society of Australia},

Clearcut logging (3.2M ha) represented 57% of all anthropogenic disturbances, reducing potential primary forest by 2.7 million ha (28%) for the IWB and 524,003 ha (39%) for the ITR. Decadal logging rates nearly doubled from 5.3% to 10.2% from 1970s–2000s. Core areas (buff-ered by 100-m from roads and developments) declined by 70% to 95% for the IWB and ITR, respec-tively. Vulnerable was assigned to karst, the only abiotic factor assessed, because it was associated with rare plants. For biotic factors, Old-Growth Birds were Vulnerable, Southern Woodland Caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) habitat and Sensitive Fish were Endangered, and Old-Growth Lichens habitat was Critical. Overall, the IWB was ranked as Endangered and the ITR as Critical with core area collapse possible within 9 to 18 years for the ITR, considered one of the world’s most imperiled temperate rainforests. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Quantifying trends in ecosystem extent is essential to understanding the status of ecosystems. Estimates of ecosystem loss are widely used to track progress toward conservation targets, monitor deforestation, and identify ecosystems undergoing rapid change. Satellite remote sensing has become an important source of information for estimating these variables. Despite regular acquisition of satellite data, many studies of change in ecosystem extent use only static snapshots, which ignores considerable amounts of data. This approach limits the ability to explicitly estimate trend uncertainty and significance. Assessing the accuracy of multiple snapshots also requires time-series reference data which is often very costly and sometimes impossible to obtain. We devised a method of estimating trends in ecosystem extent that uses all available Landsat satellite imagery. We used a dense time series of classified maps that explicitly accounted for covariates that affect extent estimates (e.g., time, cloud cover, and seasonality). We applied this approach to the Hukaung Valley Wildlife Sanctuary, Myanmar, where rapid deforestation is greatly affecting the lowland rainforest. We applied a generalized additive mixed model to estimate forest extent from more than 650 Landsat image classifications (1999–2018). Forest extent declined significantly at a rate of 0.274%/year (SE = 0.078). Forest extent declined from 91.70% (SE = 0.02) of the study area in 1999 to 86.52% (SE = 0.02) in 2018. Compared with the snapshot method, our approach improved estimated trends of ecosystem loss by allowing significance testing with confidence intervals and incorporation of nonlinear relationships. Our method can be used to identify significant trends over time, reduces the need for extensive reference data through time, and provides quantitative estimates of uncertainty. © 2020 Society for Conservation Biology},

The suggested scientific foundations for the RLE are being considered by IUCN for adoption as the backbone of the RLE. We identify conceptual and operational weaknesses in the draft RLE approach, the categories, and criteria. While species are relatively well-described units, there is no consistent means to classify ecosystems for assessing conservation status. The proposed RLE is framed mostly around certain features of ecosystems such as broad vegetation or habitat types, and do not consider major global change drivers such as climate change. We discuss technical difficulties with the proposed concept of ecosystem collapse and suggest it is not analogous to species extinction. We highlight the lack of scientific basis for the criteria and thresholds proposed by the RLE, and question the need to adopt the structure of the Red List of Species for an RLE. We suggest that the proposed RLE is open to ambiguous interpretations and uncertain outcomes, and that its practicality and benefit for conservation should be carefully evaluated before final approval. © 2014 The Authors.

	abstract = {We begin by briefly examining the achievements of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and offering it as the model and motivator for the creation of the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE). The history of the RLE concept within IUCN is briefly summarized, from the first attempt to formally establish an RLE in 1996 to the present. Major activities since 2008, when the World Conservation Congress initiated a "consultation process for the development, implementation and monitoring of a global standard for the assessment of ecosystem status, applicable at local, regional and global levels," have included: Development of a research agenda for strengthening the scientific foundations of the RLE, publication of preliminary categories and criteria for examination by the scientific and conservation community, dissemination of the effort widely by presenting it at workshops and conferences around the world, and encouraging tests of the system for a diversity of ecosystem types and in a variety of institutional settings. Between 2009 and 2012, the Red List of Ecosystems Thematic Group of the IUCN Commission on Ecosystem Management organized 18 workshops and delivered 17 conferences in 20 countries on 5 continents, directly reaching hundreds of participants. Our vision for the future includes the integration of the RLE to the other three key IUCN knowledge products (IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, World Database on Protected Areas and Key Biodiversity Areas), in an on-line, user-driven, freely-accessible information management system for performing biodiversity assessments. In addition we wish to pilot the integration of the RLE into land/water use planning and macro-economic planning. Fundamental challenges for the future include: Substantial expansion in existing institutional and technical capacity (especially in biodiversity-rich countries in the developing world), progressive assessment of the status of all terrestrial, freshwater, marine and subterranean ecosystems, and development of a map of the ecosystems of the world. Our ultimate goal is that national, regional and global RLEs are used to inform conservation and land/water use decision-making by all sectors of society. © Author(s) 2012.},

	abstract = {Aim: Distribution modelling is a useful approach to obtain knowledge about the spatial distribution of biodiversity, required for, for example, red-list assessments. While distribution modelling methods have been applied mostly to single species, modelling of communities and ecosystems (EDM; ecosystem-level distribution modelling) produces results that are more directly relevant for management and decision-making. Although the choice of predictors is a pivotal part of the modelling process, few studies have compared the suitability of different sets of predictors for EDM. In this study, we compare the performance of 50 single environmental variables with that of 11 composite landscape gradients (CLGs) for prediction of ecosystem types. The CLGs represent gradients in landscape element composition derived from multivariate analyses, for example “inner-outer coast” and “land use intensity.”. Location: Norway. Methods: We used data from field-based ecosystem-type mapping of nine ecosystem types, and environmental variables with a resolution of 100 × 100 m. We built nine models for each ecosystem type with variables from different predictor sets. Logistic regression with forward selection of variables was used for EDM. Models were evaluated with independently collected data. Results: Most ecosystem types could be predicted reliably, although model performance differed among ecosystem types. We identified significant differences in predictive power and model parsimony across models built from different predictor sets. Climatic variables alone performed poorly, indicating that the current climate alone is not sufficient to predict the current distribution of ecosystems. Used alone, the CLGs resulted in parsimonious models with relatively high predictive power. Used together with other variables, they consistently improved the models. Main conclusions: Our study highlights the importance of variable selection in EDM. We argue that the use of composite variables as proxies for complex environmental gradients has the potential to improve predictions from EDMs and thus to inform conservation planning as well as improve the precision and credibility of red lists and global change assessments. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {Aims: Red Lists of threatened species are a well-established conservation tool throughout the world. In contrast, Red Lists of ecosystems, habitats or plant community types have only recently found interest at the global level, although they have a longer tradition in Central Europe. We contribute to the debate by presenting and discussing a comprehensive conservation assessment methodology for plant communities that was developed within the framework of the project 'The plant communities of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and their vulnerability'. Location: Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Northeast Germany (23,174 km2). Approach: Our approach adopts various concepts from modern red listing and prioritization at various organizational levels of biodiversity, and combines them into a methodological framework applicable for regional to continental Red Lists of plant communities. For each distinguished plant community, three steps are carried out, i.e. (1) assessment of endangerment (scientific part, using the three criteria 'past trend', 'current status' and 'prognosis'), (2) assessment of conservation value (normative part, using the three criteria 'degree of naturalness', 'relevance for species conservation' and 'global relevance'), and (3) a combination of (1) and (2) to derive a need for action (conservation prioritization). These steps are all based on the successive aggregation of quantitative criteria via decision matrices, which makes the assessment process transparent, avoids definition gaps and allows easy adjustment of the decision rules. Conclusions: Plant community types derived from well-documented classifications of extensive vegetation-plot databases in combination with a transparent conservation assessment methodology have great potential in nature conservation and environmental monitoring. We suggest that the presented methodology is an improvement on traditional expert judgments as it separates the scientific and normative parts of the evaluation and uses clear, quantitative criteria and explicit rules to connect these into aggregated measures. It worked effectively and yielded meaningful results for a German federal state. By adjusting the scaling of the criteria, the approach can be adapted, as a whole or in part, to other regions or higher levels of ecosystem typology. © 2014 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

	abstract = {Estuarine ecosystems are increasingly threatened by coastal development and climate change. The large number of estuaries globally necessitates risk assessment to prioritise conservation efforts. Schemes for assessing risk of ecosystem collapse have been designed around terrestrial ecosystems, often defined by a single characteristic vegetation type, with their applicability to estuaries unclear. Here we consider the causes and symptoms of estuarine ecosystem collapse and assess, using a case study of the Chesapeake Bay, the applicability of ecosystem-level risk assessments to estuarine ecosystems, typified by mosaics of habitats. Functional estuaries are characterised by habitat heterogeneity and connectivity, maintenance of constituent habitats through recruitment, and a complex trophic structure including apex predators. Additionally, primary production and biomass are dominated by benthic, as opposed to pelagic, species. Hence, homogenisation of habitat types, decreased connectivity, recruitment failure, loss of apex predators and a decreased ratio of benthic to pelagic biomass may be symptoms of a trajectory towards collapse. In terrestrial ecosystems, criteria used for assessing risk of ecosystem collapse include declining or restricted distribution of ecosystems, degradation of the abiotic environment, changes in species composition and declining ecological function. As the boundaries of estuaries are typically defined by topography, rarely do significant changes in the area of the ecosystem occur. Furthermore, because the extent of estuaries is typically small, assessments based on area of occupancy may over-inflate risk. Instead, criteria based on abiotic and biotic changes, many of which are documented through monitoring programs, may be most useful for risk assessments of estuarine ecosystems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Human impacts threaten not only species, but also entire ecosystems. Ecosystems under stress can collapse or transition into different states, potentially reducing biodiversity at a variety of scales. Here we examine the vulnerability of Antarctic shallow invertebrate-dominated ecosystems, which may be threatened for several reasons. These unique shallow-water communities mostly consist of dark-adapted invertebrates, and rely on sea ice to create low-light marine environments. Climate change is likely to cause early breakout of seasonal sea ice in parts of Antarctica, which will dramatically increase the amount of light reaching shallow seabed. This is predicted to result in ecological regime shifts, in which invertebrate-dominated communities are replaced by macroalgal beds. Habitat for these endemic Antarctic ecosystems is globally rare, and the fragmented nature of their distribution along Antarctic coast increases their sensitivity to change. Concurrently, human activities in Antarctica are concentrated in areas where these habitats occur, compounding potential impacts. While there are clear mechanisms of threat to these ecosystems, lack of knowledge about their spatial distribution obscures predictions of potential ecosystem loss, and the likelihood of recovery. In this paper we describe these ecosystems, their association with the environment and the reasons for their vulnerability. We estimate their spatial distribution around Antarctica using sea ice and bathymetric data, and apply the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Ecosystems criteria to assess their vulnerability. Best available data suggest that shallow ice-covered ecosystems are likely Near Threatened to Vulnerable in places, although the magnitude of risk is spatially variable and requires additional data to strengthen the assessment. © 2015 Ecological Society of Australia.},

Underlying this challenge is the biodiversity paradox: biological diversity predominantly concentrates in the tropics, while human, institutional, and financial resources are primarily located at higher latitudes both north and south. Addressing the biodiversity paradox requires the expansion and mobilization of human, institutional and financial resources around the world. We outline a model championed by the IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) that builds on the Species Conservation Cycle (Assess-Plan-Act-Network-Communicate) and recognizes that most conservation action occurs at the national or local level. Various strategies are applied to this end by the partners of Reverse the Red, a global movement that ignites strategic cooperation and science-based action to ensure the survival of wild species and ecosystems. The SSC contributes to Reverse the Red through two primary strategies: National Species Specialist Groups and Centers for Species Survival. By building on existing expert networks and catalyzing efforts with established local institutions, we aim to significantly expand capacity to implement conservation action at the national level and reverse the negative trends indicated by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and the Red List of Ecosystems. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Aim: Stochastic threats such as disease outbreak, pollution events, fire, tsunami and drought can cause rapid species extinction and ecosystem collapse. The ability of a species or ecosystem to persist after a stochastic threat is strongly related to the extent and spatial pattern of its geographical distribution. Consequently, protocols for assessing risks to biodiversity typically include geographic range size criteria for assessing risks from stochastic threats. However, owing in part to the rarity of such events in nature, the metrics for assessing risk categories have never been tested. In this study, we investigate the performance of alternative range size metrics, including the two most widely used, extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO), as predictors of ecosystem collapse in landscapes subject to stochastic threats. Methods: We developed a spatially explicit stochastic simulation model to investigate the impacts of four threat types on a dataset of 1350 simulated geographic distributions of varying pattern and size. We empirically estimated collapse probability in response to each threat type and evaluated the ability of a set of spatial predictors to predict risk. Results: The probability of ecosystem collapse increased rapidly as range size declined. While AOO and EOO were the most important predictors of collapse risk for the three spatially explicit threats included in our model (circle, swipe and cluster), core area, patch density and mean patch size were better predictors for edge effect threats. Main conclusions: Our study is the first to quantitatively assess the range size metrics employed in biodiversity risk assessment protocols. We show that the current methods for measuring range size are the best spatial metrics for estimating risks from stochastic threats. Our simulation framework delivers an objective assessment of the performance of hitherto untested but widely used measures of geographic range size for risk assessment. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {The newly developed IUCNRed List of Ecosystems is part of a growing toolbox for assessing risks to biodiversity, which addresses ecosystems and their functioning. The Red List of Ecosystems standard allows systematic assessment of all freshwater, marine, terrestrial and subterranean ecosystem types in terms of their global risk of collapse. In addition, the Red List of Ecosystems categories and criteria provide a technical base for assessments of ecosystem status at the regional, national, or subnational level.While theRed List of Ecosystemscriteria were designed to bewidelyapplicable byscientists and practitioners, guidelines are needed to ensure they are implemented in a standardized manner to reduce epistemic uncertainties and allow robust comparisons among ecosystems and over time. We review the intended application of the Red List of Ecosystems assessment process, summarize ‘best-practice’ methods for ecosystem assessments and outline approaches to ensure operational rigour of assessments. The Red List of Ecosystems will inform priority setting for ecosystem types worldwide, and strengthen capacity to report on progress towards the Aichi Targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity. When integrated with other IUCN knowledge products, such as the World Database of Protected Areas/Protected Planet, Key Biodiversity Areas and the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the Red List of Ecosystems will contribute to providing the most complete global measure of the status of biodiversity yet achieved. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Conservation activities in fragmented landscapes have largely focused on keeping remaining large patches intact, often disregarding the increasingly important role of smaller patches in the conservation of remaining vegetation. As habitat loss proceeds in fragmented landscapes, there is an increasing need to measure the relative contribution of all patches (large and small) to overall ecosystem persistence, in a way that helps deliver effective conservation strategies aimed at preventing the death of ecosystems by a thousand cuts. Using Australian vegetation communities as a case study, we calculated the historical change in the contribution of patches below different sized thresholds to overall extent. We introduced a new patch assessment metric based on the Gini coefficient that indicates how unequal the distribution of patch sizes is relative to historical distributions. At least 22% of major vegetation communities in Australia have >50% of their remaining extent in patches <1000 ha. Loss does not always match fragmentation status: though some vegetation communities are exposed to the double jeopardy of high loss and high fragmentation, others are far more affected by fragmentation than loss of extent. For some communities, actions focused on protecting large patches are critical but for many others, protecting and managing small patches is crucial for community persistence. Synthesis and applications. Arbitrary patch size thresholds for permitting native vegetation clearing are dangerous for ecosystems whose distribution is now restricted to small patches. We recommend that clearing thresholds be scaled to reflect the fact that some ecosystems are more dominated by small patches than others. With a renewed focus on formally assessing the threat status of ecosystems as well as species, ecosystem accounts such as those demonstrated in this study are the first step to reliably assessing vulnerability. Measures of ecosystem vulnerability that only consider the extent of vegetation loss and not the size of remaining patches are likely to be ineffective for impact assessment, conservation planning and preventing ecosystem loss.

	abstract = {Ecosystem-level conservation is increasingly important at global, national and local levels. Many jurisdictions have developed and apply their own protocols for assessing the threat status of ecosystems, often independently, leading to inconsistencies between and within countries which are problematic for cross-jurisdictional environmental reporting. Australia is a good example of these historic legacies, with different risk assessment methods applied nationally and in most states. The newly developed criteria for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) provide a framework to compare and contrast apparently divergent protocols. We critically reviewed the Australian protocols and compared them with the IUCN RLE, based on the following components of a risk assessment protocol: (i) categories of threat; (ii) assessment units; (iii) underlying concepts and definitions; (iv) assessment criteria; (v) uncertainty methods; and (vi) assessment outcomes. Despite some differences in specific objectives, criteria and their expression, the protocols were structurally similar, included broadly similar types of criteria, and produced assessment outcomes that were generally concordant. Alignment with the IUCN RLE would not require extensive changes to existing protocols, but would improve consistency, rigour and robustness in ecosystem risk assessment across jurisdictions. To achieve this, we recommend: (i) more quantitative assessments of functional change; (ii) separation of management and policy considerations from risk assessment; and (iii) cross-referencing of assessment units in different jurisdictions. We argue that the focus on processes and ecological function, rather than only patterns, is key to robust risk assessment. © 2014 Ecological Society of Australia.},

The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) has developed analogous criteria for the Red List of Threatened Species in order to perform similar risk assessments on ecosystems, creating the Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) methodology. One of the most significant challenges for the construction of these lists is gathering the available information to apply the criteria. By applying IUCN RLE criteria B (the extent of restricted geographic distribution of an ecosystem), we analyzed the threat level of 64 forest ecosystems of the Ecuadorian mainland. According to the results, limited distribution is the key risk to threatened ecosystems, which are associated with anthropogenic pressures. Our study showed that 22% of forest ecosystems are classified as threatened. This evaluation of the forest ecosystem status at a national level could lead to public awareness towards ecosystem conservation and provide reasonable strategies to managers. © 2020 Noh et al.

Using this methodology, we quantified: (i) key aspects of the ecosystem's historical, current and future decline in spatial distribution; (ii) the extent of occurrence and area of occupancy for the mountain ash ecosystem; and (iii) the decline in key abiotic and biotic processes and features for historical, current and future time periods. We developed a probabilistic model of tree growth stages to estimate the risk of ecosystem collapse within 50 to 100 years in the mountain ash forest. There was uncertainty in our estimates of risk under the various IUCN criteria, with two sub-criteria being categorized as 'Data Deficient'. Our overall ranking of risk of collapse for the ecosystem was Critically Endangered. We are confident that this risk category is appropriate because all 39 scenarios modelled indicated a ≥92% chance of ecosystem collapse by 2067. Our findings highlight the important need for timely policy reform to facilitate improved management of the mountain ash ecosystem in Victoria. In particular, there needs to be greater protection of remaining areas of unburned forest, and restoration activities in parts of the forest estate. Implementation of these strategies will require a significant reduction in logging pressure on the mountain ash ecosystem. © 2014 Ecological Society of Australia.},

	abstract = {Context: Forested wetlands occurring on fluvial sediments are among the most threatened ecosystems in south-east Australia. The first quantitative diagnosis of forested wetland types in NSW was completed in 2005. Since then, there has been a three-fold increase in survey data on coastal floodplains, vegetation classification systems have been developed in New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria, and methods for the assessment of ecosystem conservation risks have been adopted by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Aims: To ensure an evidence base that can support conservation decisions and national conservation assessments, there is a need to review and update the classification of forested wetlands and integrate classification schemes across jurisdictions. Methods: We evaluated the efficacy of a multi-stage clustering strategy, applied to data from different sources with largely unknown methodological idiosyncrasies, to retrieve ecologically meaningful clusters. We assessed the veracity and robustness of the 2005 classification of forest wetlands as a framework for national risk assessments over an expanded range. Key results: We derived a quantitative, cross-jurisdictional classification of forested wetlands based on a synthesis of 5173 plot samples drawn from three states and identified the status of our units in relation to IUCN's Global Ecosystem Typology. Conclusions: Our analyses support the retention of the five legacy types which are the basis for threatened ecosystem listings under the NSW Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 and Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Implications: Our results will support revised assessments of current listings and facilitate their integration at state, national and global scales.  © 2022 Authors},

	abstract = {Land clearing and ecosystem degradation are primary causes of loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services worldwide, putting at risk sustainable options for Earth and humankind. According to recent global estimates, degraded lands already account for at least 1 and up to 6 billion ha. Given high rates of habitat degradation and loss of biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes with high levels of ecosystem transformation, conventional approaches to conservation such as setting aside lands in protected areas, are not enough; in combination with ecosystem protection, ecological restoration is essential to ensure the conservation of biodiversity and delivery of ecosystem services. Despite recognition of the role of ecological restoration, the planning of restoration at the landscape scale remains a major challenge. Specifically, more studies are needed on developing restoration plans that maximize conservation and provisioning of ecosystem services, while minimizing competition with high-productivity land uses. We use Colombia, one of the world's mega-diversity countries in which ca. 25 % of ecosystems are listed as critically endangered (CR), as a test case for exploring the potential advantages of including the Red List of Ecosystems, a newly developed tool for assessing conservation value, in restoration planning. We identified restoration priorities focused on both high-risk ecosystems and low-productivity lands, to maximize conservation value and minimize land-use conflicts. This approach allowed us to identify over 6 M ha of priority areas for restoration, targeting the restoration of 31 (75 %) of the country's endangered ecosystems. Eight of the Regional Administrative Environmental Planning Areas (CARs) had greater than 20 % of their area identified as restoration priorities. We roughly estimated that the cost of restoring the prioritized areas with restoration through natural regeneration, using payment for ecosystem services (PES), would equal less than 50 % of the annual budget of the CARs. Our results are in sharp contrast (only 12 % agreement) with the priorities identified under the current National Restoration Strategy of Colombia, and highlight the potential contribution of the Red List of Ecosystems in refining and improving restoration planning strategies at both national and sub-national levels. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) is an emerging global standard for ecosystem risk assessment that integrates data and knowledge to document the relative risk status of ecosystem types. Here, we summarize initial findings from applying four IUCN RLE criteria to 655 terrestrial ecosystems in temperate and tropical North America, or 8.5% of the global land surface. A series of indicators are measured for each criterion to address trends in ecosystem extent (A), the relative restricted nature of its distribution (B), and the extent and relative severity of environmental degradation (C), and the extent and relative severity of disruption of biotic processes (D); all to gauge the probability of range wide “collapse.” Ecosystems are listed as collapsed, critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable, near threatened, least concern, data deficient, or not evaluated. Taking uncertainty into account, 219 (33%) of terrestrial ecosystem types were listed as threatened (i.e., either critically endangered, [7%], endangered [14%], or vulnerable [13%]). Examples include tallgrass prairies, oak savannas, longleaf pine woodlands, floodplain forests, mesic hardwood forests, and dry tropical forests. Historically, these threatened ecosystems occurred across about 45% of the continental study area, and today account for about 30%. The RLE provides one important focus for prioritizing conservation effort. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Myanmar is highly biodiverse, with more than 16,000 plant, 314 mammal, 1131 bird, 293 reptile, and 139 amphibian species. Supporting this biodiversity is a variety of natural ecosystems—mostly undescribed—including tropical and subtropical forests, savannas, seasonally inundated wetlands, extensive shoreline and tidal systems, and alpine ecosystems. Although Myanmar contains some of the largest intact natural ecosystems in Southeast Asia, remaining ecosystems are under threat from accelerating land use intensification and over-exploitation. In this period of rapid change, a systematic risk assessment is urgently needed to estimate the extent and magnitude of human impacts and identify ecosystems most at risk to help guide strategic conservation action. Here we provide the first comprehensive conservation assessment of Myanmar's natural terrestrial ecosystems using the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems categories and criteria. We identified 64 ecosystem types for the assessment, and used models of ecosystem distributions and syntheses of existing data to estimate declines in distribution, range size, and functioning of each ecosystem. We found that more than a third (36.9%) of Myanmar's area has been converted to anthropogenic ecosystems over the last 2–3 centuries, leaving nearly half of Myanmar's ecosystems threatened (29 of 64 ecosystems). A quarter of Myanmar's ecosystems were identified as Data Deficient, reflecting a paucity of studies and an urgency for future research. Our results show that, with nearly two-thirds of Myanmar still covered in natural ecosystems, there is a crucial opportunity to develop a comprehensive protected area network that sufficiently represents Myanmar's terrestrial ecosystem diversity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Natural systems are declining at an unparalleled rate. To prompt conservation of ecosystems, the IUCN has developed a framework to assess ecosystem threat. By 2025, the IUCN aims to assess the collapse risk of all the world's ecosystems using this framework. This increases the pressure to refine tractable methods to predict collapse. However, there has been no systematic review of whether predicting collapse is possible and practical, which is impeding consistent and comparable assessments of ecosystem threat. Here, we conduct such a review and highlight six areas of concern – stemming from the findings of our review – in need of immediate attention to progress work on assessing ecosystem collapse and the application of such assessments to the management of at-risk ecosystems. These are: (1) better conceptualizations of ecosystems, (2) better conceptualizations of ecosystem collapse, (3) improved integration of theory, experimentation, and practice, (4) improved surrogates and early warning indicators of ecosystem collapse, (5) the implementation of management experiments to enhance understanding of ecosystem stability, and (6) ensuring IUCN Red List of Ecosystems listings result in the conservation of biodiversity.

They are defined by calcareous rock (dolostone, limestone, or marble) plains with exposed pavement, thin soil with grasslands, or forested areas that are usually stunted. One of the largest alvars in the Great Lakes region is the Carden Alvar Natural Area (Carden), which is in southern Ontario 100 km NNE of Toronto and 25 km E of Orillia. In recent decades, recognition of the rare and uncommon species inhabiting Carden has led to the protection of 3035 of its 12,873 ha (24%). To continue to better understand Carden's wildlife, the first detailed survey of the lichens and allied fungi was completed in 2015 and is presented herein. The study was conducted on protected lands and revealed 199 species in 99 genera. Twenty-five species are provincially listed as S1 (critically imperiled), S2 (imperiled), or S3 (vulnerable) by the Ontario Natural Heritage Information Centre, several species represent major range extensions in the province, and a high number (17) of species with cyanobacteria as their primary photobiont were discovered. Results from this study can assist land managers in Carden to identify areas of high conservation value, develop sound conservation strategies, and justify the purchase or donation of additional property for conservation purposes. © 2019 E-flow BioOne.

	abstract = {The criteria used by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) for its Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) are the global standards for ecosystem-level risk assessment, and they have been increasingly used for biodiversity conservation. The changed distribution area of an ecosystem is one of the key criteria in such assessments. The Stipa bungeana grassland is one of the most widely distributed grasslands in the warm-temperate semi-arid regions of China. However, the total distribution area of this grassland was noted to have shrunk and become fragmented because of its conversion to cropland and grazing-induced degradation. Following the IUCN-RLE standards, here we analyzed changes in the geographical distribution of this degraded grassland, to evaluate its degradation and risk of collapse. Past (1950-1980) distribution areas were extracted from the Vegetation Map of China (1:1,000,000). Present realizable distribution areas were equated to these past areas minus any habitat area losses. We then predicted the grassland’s present and future (under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario) potential distribution areas using maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt), based on field survey data and nine environmental layers. Our results showed that the S. bungeana grassland was mainly distributed in the Loess Plateau, Hexi Corridor, and low altitudes of the Qilian Mountains and Longshou Mountain. This ecosystem occurred mainly on loess soils, kastanozems, steppe aeolian soils and sierozems. Thermal and edaphic factors were the most important factors limiting the distribution of S. bungeana grassland across China. Since 56.1% of its past distribution area (4.9×104 km2) disappeared in the last 50 a, the present realizable distribution area only amounts to 2.2×104 km2. But only 15.7% of its present potential distribution area (14.0×104 km2) is actually occupied by the S. bungeana grassland. The future potential distribution of S. bungeana grassland was predicted to shift towards northwest, and the total area of this ecosystem will shrink by 12.4% over the next 50 a under the most pessimistic climate change scenario. Accordingly, following the IUCN-RLE criteria, we deemed the S. bungeana grassland ecosystem in China to be endangered (EN). Revegetation projects and the establishment of protected areas are recommended as effective ways to avert this looming crisis. This empirical modeling study provides an example of how IUCN-RLE categories and criteria may be valuably used for ecosystem assessments in China and abroad. © 2020, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The European Habitat Directive encompasses a conservation policy devoted to conserve habitats rather than single species. This ambition has strong ecological justifications, and inspires other initiatives such as the IUCN red list of ecosystems. Evaluating this policy is therefore pivotal to identify and reproduce best practices. However, the habitat aspect of this policy has so far not been systematically assessed. To make up for this lacuna, we take advantage of decision-aiding methodologies to introduce a new normative framework. According to this framework, a conservation policy is positively evaluated if it contributes to conservation, is science-based, operational, and legitimate. Based on an exploration of the published literature and unpublished reports and databases, we identify knowledge gaps plaguing the European habitat conservation policy. We argue that, due to these knowledge gaps, the contribution of this policy to the conservation of habitats is unproven, it is not science-based, not operational and not legitimate. Our study draws heavily on the French implementation. Analyzing this example, we highlight knowledge gaps that carry lessons for European conservation policies as a whole, but also for conservation initiatives focused on habitats in a broader geographical and political context. We then identify concrete means to strengthen habitats conservation policies. © 2016 The Authors. Conservation Letters published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Risk assessment protocols and ecosystem models integrate limited observational data with threat scenarios, making them valuable tools for monitoring ecosystem status and diagnosing key mechanisms of decline to be addressed by management. We applied the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems criteria to quantify the risk of collapse of the Meso-American Reef, a unique ecosystem containing the second longest barrier reef in the world. We collated a wide array of empirical data (field and remotely sensed), and used a stochastic ecosystem model to backcast past ecosystem dynamics, as well as forecast future ecosystem dynamics under 11 scenarios of threat. The ecosystem is at high risk from mass bleaching in the coming decades, with compounding effects of ocean acidification, hurricanes, pollution and fishing. The overall status of the ecosystem is Critically Endangered (plausibly Vulnerable to Critically Endangered), with notable differences among Red List criteria and data types in detecting the most severe symptoms of risk.

	abstract = {For 50 years, the IUCN Commissions, Secretariat, Members such as BirdLife International and partners such as UNEP-WCMC have been mobilising biodiversity and conservation knowledge products, which are fundamentally important for tracking progress towards 10 of the 20 Aichi Targets, and should similarly become so for seven of the emerging 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. Each of these knowledge products comprises standards, governance and quality control, data sets, tools, capacity building and ongoing processes for derivation of biodiversity indicators. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, established in 1964, documents extinction risk for more than 76,000 species. Protected Planet, working from the mandate to provide the UN List of Protected Areas, is convened jointly with UNEP and documents ~220,000 protected areas. The Red List of Ecosystems aims to assess the risk of collapse of ecosystems, and is currently being piloted in a number of countries. Key Biodiversity Areas are sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, identified at national levels using globally standard criteria. The system has been developed over the last four decades by BirdLife International and others with ~15,000 sites identified; it is anticipated that IUCN will approve the umbrella standard around these existing approaches in 2015. Of the 55 global indicators mobilised for mid-term assessment of progress towards the Aichi Targets for the fourth Global Biodiversity Outlook, nearly a third were wholly or partly based on these knowledge products (spanning 10 of the Aichi Targets). Indicators derived from these knowledge products will also be applicable to seven of the Sustainable Development Goals. However, annual investment into these knowledge products is currently only a fraction of that necessary to maintain their currency, quality, and scope. If these key indicators towards the Aichi Targets are to be maintained, sustainable long-term financing mechanisms must be established to resource the underlying knowledge products. © 2015 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Reef ecosystems all over the world are in decline and managers urgently need information that can assess management interventions and set national conservation targets. We assess the conservation status and risk of ecosystem collapse for the Oyster Reef Ecosystem of Southern and Eastern Australia, which comprises two community sub-types established by Saccostrea glomerata (Sydney rock oyster) and Ostrea angasi (Australian flat oyster), consistent with the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems risk assessment process. We established: (i) key aspects of the ecosystem including: ecological description, biological characteristics, condition and collapse thresholds, natural and threatening processes; (ii) previous and current extent of occurrence and current area of occupancy; and (iii) its likelihood of collapse within the next 50–100 years. The most severe risk rating occurred for Criterion A: Reduction in Extent (since 1750) and Criterion D: Disruption of biotic processes (since 1750), although assessment varied from Least Concern to Critically Endangered amongst the four criteria assessed. Our overall assessment ranks the risk of collapse for the ecosystem (including both community sub-types) as Critically Endangered with a high degree of confidence. Our results suggest the need for rapid intervention to protect remaining reefs and undertake restoration at suitable sites. Several restoration projects have already demonstrated this is feasible, and Australia is well equipped with government policies and regulatory mechanisms to support the future conservation and recovery of temperate oyster ecosystems. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {Accurately evaluating ecosystem status is vital for effective conservation. The Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is the global standard for assessing the risk of ecosystem collapse. Such tools are particularly needed for large, dynamic ecosystem complexes, such as the Indian Sundarbans mangrove forest. This ecosystem supports unique biodiversity and the livelihoods of millions, but like many mangrove forests around the world is facing substantial pressure from a range of human activities. Holistic, standardised and quantitative environment risk assessment frameworks are essential here, because previous assessments have either been qualitative in nature, or have generally considered single threats in isolation. We review these threats and utilise the RLE framework to quantitatively assess the risk of ecosystem collapse. Historical clearing and diminishing fish populations drove a status of Endangered (range: Vulnerable to Endangered), and ongoing threats including climate change and reduced freshwater supply may further impact this ecosystem. However, considering recent change, the outlook is more optimistic. Mangrove extent has stabilised, and analysis of mangrove condition highlights that only a small proportion of the forest is degraded. Using the RLE provides an authoritative avenue for further protection and recognition of the issues facing this UNESCO World Heritage Site. We also identify knowledge and data gaps in the Sundarbans that are likely common to coastal systems globally. By articulating these and presenting opportunities and recommendations, we aim to further the conservation goals of the IUCN and the implementation of its new assessment framework. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

A series of indicators for each type gauge the probability of range wide “collapse”. Climate change vulnerability can factor into RLE assessments, especially as indicators of climate change severity under the criteria for environmental degradation over the recent and upcoming 50 years. We applied a new framework to assess climate change vulnerability—and thus, severity of climate change degradation—to a cross-section of 33 upland ecosystem types in the United States to demonstrate this input to the RLE. The framework addressed climate exposure and ecosystem resilience. Measures of climate change exposure used climate projections for the mid-21st century compared against a 20th century baseline. Augmenting measures in use for RLE assessment, measures of resilience included several for adaptive capacity, including topoclimate variability, diversity with functional species groups, and vulnerability of any keystone species. All 33 types were listed as VU (n = 22), EN (n = 9), or CR (n = 2) and 51% scored at least one step higher (e.g., LC up to VU) from climate change severity. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Biological diversity provides many ecosystem functions and services that are critically important for human survival and development. In the past hundreds of years, biodiversity decreases continuously due to accelerating human activities and climate changes, leading to the alteration of ecosystem processes and ecosystems stability. An explicit understanding of risks assessment of biodiversity loss is essential for biological conservation. However, traditional risk assessment mainly focused on species diversity, which could not represent biological diversity comprehensively and reflect biodiversity loss at ecosystem level directly. The results of assessment can hardly be applied to policy-making for biodiversity conservation at landscape level. Furthermore, species-by-species is time consuming and resources costing. By the year 2010, less than 3% of the world’s known species had been evaluated for potential inclusion in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Hence, a higher-level biodiversity assessment may provide a more cost-effective means for multi-scale biodiversity conservation. Recently, more and more attentions have been tailored to develop a set of criteria for ecosystem risk assessment. Several protocols have been developed in many countries over the past twenty years, such as Finland, Germany, Denmark and Bulgaria. Most of these assessment protocols adopted the assessment system of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Threat status was adopted as the major ecosystem risk assessment indicator, and threat status of each ecosystem was assigned using rule-based criteria based on thresholds for distributional and functional symptoms. However, there are significant differences between ecosystem classification, quantitative criteria, and spatial/temporal scale in different protocols, leading to possible distortions in results of assessment. In the year of 2008, IUCN created the Ecosystems Red List (RLE) Thematic Group that aims to develop a quantitative categories and criteria system, in order to establish a global standard for the ecosystem risks assessment that can be applied at local, regional, and global levels. The group released first version of ecosystem risk assessment system in 2011 which mainly consist of the definition and classification of ecosystems, identification of the threat status of ecosystems, quantitative criteria of ecosystem distributions and ecological functions, thresholds for these criteria, and standardized methods for assessments. IUCN Red List criteria for ecosystems version 2.0 was released two years later, along with twenty case studies to test the criteria. On the basis of previous version, the latest version introduced the criteria of environmental degradation and the ecosystem collapse, providing a workable and robust framework for ecosystem risk assessment. Up to now, there have been many countries that applied RLE categories and criteria to assess the ecosystem risk at regional or national scale, such as South Africa, Norway, Venezuela, Canada and New Zealand. Our study reviewed the ecosystem risk assessment protocols mentioned above, and found that IUCN Red List criteria for ecosystems are the most reasonable ecosystem risk assessment tools at present. We also briefly introduced the progress and future works of ecosystem assessment in China, and analyzed the importance and feasibility of applied RLE categories and criteria to assess ecosystem risk at national scale. We close by considering how to improve the ability of ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation using RLE and putting forward suggestions for developing RLE in China. © 2015, Ecological Society of China.

	abstract = {Understanding how biodiversity is changing is a crucial step in mitigating our environmental impacts. Biodiversity indicators synthesise and communicate status and trends in biodiversity, including progress towards global targets. Despite their importance in decision making, few indicators have been tested for their performance and behaviour. Here, we tested the sensitivity, responsiveness and complementarity of three indices synthesising status and trends in collapse risk, spatial distribution and health of ecosystems (i.e., the IUCN Red List Index of Ecosystems, the Ecosystem Area index, and the Ecosystem Health Index). We used a stochastic coral reef ecosystem model to evaluate the indices’ ability to detect changes in biodiversity under various future scenarios. We aimed to: i) test the indices’ sensitivity to detecting change under low and high threat; ii) examine their responsiveness in detecting changes at the onset of and changes in threat levels; iii) assess complementarity among the indices’ trends and values; and iv) explore the impact on the indices’ sensitivity and responsiveness to sampling decisions, including the scale of ecosystem classification, ecological variables used in their calculation, and frequency of reporting. Our study revealed that the ecosystem indices are sensitive, responsive and offer complementary information on changes in ecosystems, although the Red List Index of Ecosystems sometimes behaved counter-intuitively. The indices’ sensitivity and responsiveness depended on the nature of the threats and could be adversely affected by decisions made in the assessment process; careful variable selection in the Red List of Ecosystems assessment process is critical to reliability detecting ecosystem change. Our results suggest that that 5-year intervals in ecosystem assessment can reveal informative trends, suggesting that current guidelines for reassessment are sufficient. Our study is one of the few examples of a systematic evaluation of biodiversity indicator performance. Our findings will help improve our understanding of the reliability of these ecosystem indices as decision-support tools in local to global contexts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest (SDTF) is one of the most threatened ecosystems worldwide and in Colombia it is considered critically endangered according to the national red list of ecosystems. Ongoing processes of fragmentation and degradation of SDTFs are expected to be accompanied by a loss of genetic diversity of the tree populations contained in it. Identifying remaining healthy tree populations is key for the implementation of conservation and restoration programs that embrace genetic diversity to enhance the capacity of populations to adapt to environmental changes. We studied the genetic diversity and structure of Astronium graveolens, one of the most ubiquitous species in Colombian SDTFs, across ten representative populations. We assess the relevance of the dry forest refugia hypothesis (DFRH) for explaining the observed genetic structures. We identified three genetic clusters which may have originated through prolonged isolation of populations. The most diverse cluster ranges from the Caribbean region to the Chicamocha river canyon which may reflect their connectedness during the last glacial period. A second cluster likely originated through isolation in a small area enclosed in the Caribbean region. The third cluster groups populations from the Cauca and Magdalena river valleys, suggesting cross-Andean expansion of populations at one point in time, thus corroborating similar findings for other species of SDTFs. Our results add to a growing number of studies providing support for the DFRH. All the populations sampled showed heterozygosity scores close to the Hardy-Weinberg expectations, suggesting populations might be relatively resistant to habitat fragmentation. However, our suitability modelling results suggest that climate change might imperil numerous areas in SDTFs where the species occurs today, including some that hold unique genetic diversity. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {An understanding of risks to biodiversity is needed for planning action to slow current rates of decline and secure ecosystem services for future human use. Although the IUCN Red List criteria provide an effective assessment protocol for species, a standard global assessment of risks to higher levels of biodiversity is currently limited. In 2008, IUCN initiated development of risk assessment criteria to support a global Red List of ecosystems. We present a new conceptual model for ecosystem risk assessment founded on a synthesis of relevant ecological theories. To support the model, we review key elements of ecosystem definition and introduce the concept of ecosystem collapse, an analogue of species extinction. The model identifies four distributional and functional symptoms of ecosystem risk as a basis for assessment criteria: A) rates of decline in ecosystem distribution; B) restricted distributions with continuing declines or threats; C) rates of environmental (abiotic) degradation; and D) rates of disruption to biotic processes. A fifth criterion, E) quantitative estimates of the risk of ecosystem collapse, enables integrated assessment of multiple processes and provides a conceptual anchor for the other criteria. We present the theoretical rationale for the construction and interpretation of each criterion. The assessment protocol and threat categories mirror those of the IUCN Red List of species. A trial of the protocol on terrestrial, subterranean, freshwater and marine ecosystems from around the world shows that its concepts are workable and its outcomes are robust, that required data are available, and that results are consistent with assessments carried out by local experts and authorities. The new protocol provides a consistent, practical and theoretically grounded framework for establishing a systematic Red List of the world's ecosystems.

	abstract = {Coral reefs are of global economic and biological significance but are subject to increasing threats. As a result, it is essential to understand the risk of coral reef ecosystem collapse and to develop assessment process for those ecosystems. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Ecosystem (RLE) is a framework to assess the vulnerability of an ecosystem. Importantly, the assessment processes need to be repeatable as new monitoring data arises. The repeatability will also enhance transparency. In this paper, we discuss the evolution of a computational pipeline for risk assessment of the Meso-American reef ecosystem, a diverse reef ecosystem located in the Caribbean, with the focus on improving the execution time starting from sequential and parallel implementation and finally using Apache Spark. The final form of the pipeline is a scientific workflow to improve its repeatability and reproducibility. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Over the last several years, the IUCN Red List approach for assessing the risk of extinction faced by species has been adapted into a Red List of Ecosystems methodology. This endeavor faces several important challenges, including how to define the types of ecosystems to which the Red List criteria are applied, and how to manage information on the geographic distribution of ecosystems in an open, transparent, and standardized manner linking mapping, typology, and field studies. We propose a fundamentally novel approach that differs from currently available ecosystem typologies in three important aspects by (1) offering a new way of conceptualizing types of ecosystems, (2) providing an explicit method for communicating the conceptualized ecosystems and how they are circumscribed, and (3) developing technical tools for managing the resulting conceptual model. Firstly, ecosystem types are defined by studying biogeoclimatic gradients using an approach that is both modular (in which combinations of ecological factors are studied at a given scale) and hierarchical (involving relative spatial and temporal scales in which local/site gradients are dependent on bioclimatic/regional gradients). This avoids the problem of classes that are not mutually exclusive and enables the classification of all types of ecosystems, including for example marshes on rocky outcrops in superhumid tropical montane areas. Secondly, the names of ecosystem species are linked to a nomenclatural type defined by a ‘type site’ or ‘biotype’, adopting a principle that makes clear a given author's notion of an ecosystem type even if the accompanying name and description are partial or imperfect, or when the ecosystem type is delimited too broadly according to the interpretation of another author. Ecosystem names are structured as a descriptive diagnosis based on a standardized set of characters and character states. This typological approach for facilitating the naming and comparison of ecosystem circumscriptions is thus truly taxonomic in nature. Thirdly, in order to facilitate the use and application of the conceptual approach presented here, we translate it into a practical tool by developing a smartphone-based system to collect data for observing and describing virtual ecosystem specimens in the field, along with the "Bio" database, which manages ecosystem data and also enables tracking synonymies using an open system that entails assigning determinavits to biotypes. © 2021},

	abstract = {Quantifying ecological condition, notably the extent of forest degradation is important for understanding and designing measures to protect biodiversity and enhancing the capacity of forests to deliver ecosystem services. Conservation planning, particularly the prioritization of management interventions for forests, is often lacking spatial data on forest degradation, and it is often overlooked within decision-making processes. We develop a continuous metric termed Forest Condition (FC) which aims to measure the degree of forest degradation on a scale from 0 to 100, incorporating the temporal history of forest change over any spatial extent. We parameterize this metric based on estimated changes in above ground biomass in the context of forest fragmentation over time to estimate a continuous measure of forest degradation for Congo Basin countries. We estimate that just <70% of Congo Basin forests remain fully intact, a decrease from 78% in the year 2000. FC was validated by direct remote sensing measurements from Landsat imagery for DRC. Results showed that FC was significantly positively correlated with forest canopy cover, gap area per hectare, and magnitude of temporal change in Normalized Burn Ratio. We tested the ability of FC to distinguish primary and secondary degradation and deforestation and found significant differences in gap area and spectral anomalies to validate our theoretical model. We apply the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems criteria to demonstrate the integration of forest condition to assess the risk of ecosystem collapse. Based on this assessment, we found that without including FC in the assessment of biotic disruption, 12 ecosystems representing over 11% of forested area in 2015 would not have been assigned a threat status, and an additional 9 ecosystems would have a lower threat status. Our overall assessment of ecosystems found about half of all Congo Basin ecosystem types, accounting for 20% of all forest area are threatened to some degree, including 4 ecosystems (<1% of total area) which are critically engendered. FC is a transferrable and scalable assessment to support forest monitoring, planning, and management. © 2020 The Author(s)},
