The [IUCN Red List of Ecosystems](https://iucnrle.org) Categories and Criteria is a global standard for how we assess the conservation status of ecosystems, applicable at local, national, regional and global levels.  It is based on a set of rules, or criteria, for performing evidence-based, scientific assessments of the risk of ecosystem collapse, as measured by reductions in geographical distribution or degradation of the key processes and components of ecosystems.
