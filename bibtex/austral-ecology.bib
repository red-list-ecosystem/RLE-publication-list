abstract = {Abstract Ecosystem conservation is important for biodiversity and for human well-being. Understanding the relative risks to ecosystems is fundamental to well-informed ecosystem management. The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems protocol provides an adaptable framework for risk assessment across terrestrial, subterranean, freshwater and marine ecosystems. I review a series of detailed case studies, published in this special edition of Austral Ecology, that apply the Red List of Ecosystems criteria to a broad range of ecosystem types. These studies show that detailed risk assessments are especially valuable as forerunners to strategic ecosystem management. Key components of Red List assessments that contribute to development of management strategies include critical diagnosis of trends and their causes, identification of dependencies that influence ecosystem responses to environmental change and selection of ecosystem-specific diagnostic variables that can be useful monitoring tools for evaluating the performance of management. Ecosystem Red List assessments are crucial to regulatory processes under environmental legislation in Australia and other countries. The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem criteria will help improve the scientific rigour of statutory listings and could also provide a unifying framework for the suite of listing processes that differ among jurisdictions for historical reasons. When integrated with a comprehensive ecosystem typology, ecosystem Red List assessments can also provide critical input into systematic conservation planning. The case studies demonstrate a range of analytical approaches to risk assessment framed to accommodate data of varying quality and abundance. I conclude by exploring opportunities and requirements for a systematic continental-scale Red List assessment of Australian ecosystems.},

abstract = {Abstract Ecosystem-level conservation is increasingly important at global, national and local levels. Many jurisdictions have developed and apply their own protocols for assessing the threat status of ecosystems, often independently, leading to inconsistencies between and within countries which are problematic for cross-jurisdictional environmental reporting. Australia is a good example of these historic legacies, with different risk assessment methods applied nationally and in most states. The newly developed criteria for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) provide a framework to compare and contrast apparently divergent protocols. We critically reviewed the Australian protocols and compared them with the IUCN RLE, based on the following components of a risk assessment protocol: (i) categories of threat; (ii) assessment units; (iii) underlying concepts and definitions; (iv) assessment criteria; (v) uncertainty methods; and (vi) assessment outcomes. Despite some differences in specific objectives, criteria and their expression, the protocols were structurally similar, included broadly similar types of criteria, and produced assessment outcomes that were generally concordant. Alignment with the IUCN RLE would not require extensive changes to existing protocols, but would improve consistency, rigour and robustness in ecosystem risk assessment across jurisdictions. To achieve this, we recommend: (i) more quantitative assessments of functional change; (ii) separation of management and policy considerations from risk assessment; and (iii) cross-referencing of assessment units in different jurisdictions. We argue that the focus on processes and ecological function, rather than only patterns, is key to robust risk assessment.},

abstract = {Abstract Gnarled Mossy Cloud Forest is a globally unique ecosystem, combining floristic elements from Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia. It is restricted to a very small area (28 ha) at elevations above 750 m on the summits of two mountains on Lord Howe Island in the Pacific Ocean, approximately 570 km off the east coast of Australia. Moisture derived from clouds is a key feature of the ecosystem. We assessed the conservation status of this ecosystem using the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List criteria for ecosystems. There has been no historical clearing of the ecosystem, but declines (with large uncertainty bounds) were estimated for two abiotic variables that are important in maintaining the component species (cloud cover and rainfall). Overall, we found the ecosystem to be Critically Endangered based on a restricted geographic distribution combined with continuing decline (criterion B1aii, iii, B1b, B1c and B2aii, iii, B2b, B2c). Decline was inferred from: a loss of moisture from declining rainfall and cloud cover due to climate change (affecting disturbance regimes, gap formation and species survival and recruitment); ongoing exotic rat predation on seeds and seedlings of several sensitive species that are structural components of the ecosystem (affecting survival and recruitment); and the fact that the ecosystem is considered to exist at only one location. This mirrors similar threats from exotic species and climate change to other Pacific island cloud forests. Eradication of rats from Lord Howe Island will reduce the immediate risk to this ecosystem; however, only global mitigation of greenhouse gases could alleviate risk from declining cloud cover and moisture availability.},

abstract = {Abstract Lowland rainforest communities are among the most threatened across South-east Asia as a result of ease of access, suitability for agriculture and proximity to population centres along the coast and to ports for export of timber, minerals and agricultural produce. In Australia, coastal lowland rainforest occupies a narrow band between the marine-influenced littoral communities and the forests of the coastal ranges and uplands in the Wet Tropics Bioregion of north-east Queensland. As the coastal lowlands were already highly fragmented, and subject to ongoing conversion for agriculture and urbanization, they were excluded from the World Heritage listing of the Wet Tropics of Queensland in 1988. Littoral rainforest and broad-leaved tea-tree swamps in the coastal zone have both recently been protected under Commonwealth environmental protection legislation; meanwhile, the remnant coastal lowland rainforest faces continued threats from extreme events, climate change, land management activities and introduced species. In a risk assessment based on IUCN guidelines, coastal lowland rainforest was assessed as endangered due to restricted distribution (full extent of the community encompassed by a minimum complex polygon less than 20 000 km2) in conjunction with qualitative evidence of disruption to biotic interactions. A second criterion related to the historic decline in geographic distribution (60\% decline in distribution since 1750) would correspond to a condition of vulnerable. Coastal lowland rainforest on alluvial soils has been particularly impacted, and a 75\% decline in distribution since 1760 would correspond to a condition of endangered for this subtype. We had insufficient data to address the remaining IUCN Red List criteria for ecosystems, but point to published studies which address these criteria at the subregional level, and make suggestions for future data collection, monitoring and analyses which may support future reviews or proposals for enhanced protection within an Australian legislative context.},

abstract = {Abstract We applied an ecosystem risk assessment to the mountain ash forest ecosystem of the Central Highlands of Victoria (hereafter ‘mountain ash forest’), south-eastern Australia, using the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems criteria. Using this methodology, we quantified: (i) key aspects of the ecosystem's historical, current and future decline in spatial distribution; (ii) the extent of occurrence and area of occupancy for the mountain ash ecosystem; and (iii) the decline in key abiotic and biotic processes and features for historical, current and future time periods. We developed a probabilistic model of tree growth stages to estimate the risk of ecosystem collapse within 50 to 100 years in the mountain ash forest. There was uncertainty in our estimates of risk under the various IUCN criteria, with two sub-criteria being categorized as ‘Data Deficient’. Our overall ranking of risk of collapse for the ecosystem was Critically Endangered. We are confident that this risk category is appropriate because all 39 scenarios modelled indicated a ≥92\% chance of ecosystem collapse by 2067. Our findings highlight the important need for timely policy reform to facilitate improved management of the mountain ash ecosystem in Victoria. In particular, there needs to be greater protection of remaining areas of unburned forest, and restoration activities in parts of the forest estate. Implementation of these strategies will require a significant reduction in logging pressure on the mountain ash ecosystem.},

abstract = {Abstract The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has proposed a standard global assessment protocol for the evaluation of conservation risks to ecosystems. The assessment criteria mirror the IUCN protocol for the assessment of species, however there are relatively few case studies available to demonstrate their utility across a broad range of ecosystems. We applied the IUCN protocol to assess the conservation status of the Cumberland Plain Woodland (CPW) located in the western suburbs of Sydney, Australia. The ecosystem has been the focus of extensive survey and research and has been determined to be critically endangered under NSW and Australian Government legislation, primarily as a consequence of its history of extensive clearing. The outcome of the risk assessment for CPW using the IUCN protocol was identical to those under the NSW and Australian legislation. Data for risk assessment fell into two categories, each with different limitations. Phytosocialogical data and distribution models provided a strong basis for quantifying past and future changes in the distribution of CPW, but offered only indirect measures of functional symptoms of decline. Conversely, local case studies documenting declines in ecosystem function due to weed invasion, soil disturbance and alteration of fire regimes could not easily be extrapolated in order to evaluate the assessment criteria. The critically endangered rating was based solely on the historic reduction in geographic distribution (92–94\%), however clearing poses an ongoing threat to the ecosystem. The contemporary clearing rate of CPW is approximately half the historical average but there is evidence that the rate will double in the next decade as a consequence of ongoing urbanisation and Government policy of biodiversity offsets. A systematic approach to documenting the extent of environmental degradation and disruption to biotic processes would assist the assessment of CPW and other ecosystems against the IUCN criteria.},

abstract = {Abstract The south west of Western Australia is a global biodiversity hotspot that contains a suite of highly restricted and threatened ecosystems. In common with some other global hotspots, this region has high levels of alpha, beta and gamma diversity characterized by local endemism and spatial turnover of species. The region therefore includes a suite of highly localized species assemblages in complex mosaics across the landscape. Such landscapes pose particular challenges for assessing risks to biodiversity because the status of the most extensive species assemblages within broad scale assessment units tends to mask the status of those that are most restricted. Hence, risk assessments at different thematic scales may sometimes reveal different outcomes and salient threats. We examined these expectations by applying the IUCN Red List criteria for ecosystems at a fine thematic scale to assess risks to shrublands on southern Swan Coastal Plain ironstones, one of the most restricted ecosystems in the region, distinguished by its component suite of endemic flora. The ecosystem was found to be critically endangered due to its declining distribution and restricted current extent in combination with threats, particularly weed invasion. These outcomes suggest two scaling effects when a broader suite of assemblages in the region are considered; the perceived levels of risk may be less extreme; and the main threatening processes that influence risk assessment outcomes rank differently in importance. Both effects are critical to future management to promote persistence of ecosystems, as the priorities and actions will vary between local and regional scales, as will their conservation outcomes. In this case the major needs are to limit vegetation clearing and water extraction and mitigate the invasion of weeds and impacts of disease. The relative emphasis on these strategies varies between local and regional scales.},

In the otherwise subdued landscapes of the floristically diverse Southwest Western Australian Floristic Region, the Stirling Range provides the region's only distinctly montane environments. On the highest peaks of the Range the characteristic heathland (Kwongan) of the region becomes a dense shrub thicket with many endemic species and is known as the Eastern Stirling Range Montane Heath and Thicket. We assessed the conservation status of the Montane Heath and Thicket using the IUCN Red list criteria for ecosystems. We found the ecosystem to be Critically Endangered based on its naturally limited geographic extent and area of occupancy in combination with the impacts of the plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi. Historical sources and long-term monitoring were critical to our assessment of this ecosystem highlighting their importance in detecting and understanding likely causes of change. The ecosystem is predicted to decline further in the absence of intensive management due to current threatening processes as well as the potential future impacts of climate change. The Montane Heath and Thicket, while substantially modified still retains areas with highly significant conservation values and these pose many challenges for management. Continued management of P. cinnamomi through phosphite application and management of fire return intervals will be critical to conserve the remaining areas of the thicket where sensitive plant species occur together with an ex situ conservation program including ongoing seed collection and translocation for the most threatened species.},

abstract = {Abstract Alpine ecosystems are globally at risk from climate change. We use the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List Criteria for ecosystems to assess the risk of ecosystem collapse in Australian alpine snow patch herbfields. These ecosystems occur on both mainland Australia and Tasmania. They are restricted to steep, south-easterly slopes where snow pack persists well into the summer growing season. Consequently, they are rare, and have high conservation significance. We evaluated the risk of snow patch herbfield ‘ecosystem collapse’ against criteria that accounted for the ecosystem's restricted distribution, projected decline in the snowpack and increased rates of invasion by taller growing native species of shrub and grass. Our analyses revealed considerable uncertainty in estimates of risk based on some criteria, particularly those related to thresholds of ecosystem collapse caused by biotic change. On the basis of the IUCN Red List criteria, we conclude that the ecosystem is ‘endangered’. This is because of the restricted geographical distribution of the ecosystem, a substantial and highly likely decline in the abundance of snow (the principal abiotic driver of the ecosystem), and the prospect of invasion of much of the ecosystem by taller growing native shrubs and grasses. Our case study demonstrates the utility of the Red List methodology for assessing risks to biodiversity in rare ecosystems where changes to both abiotic factors and the relative dominance of native species constitute major threats. Our findings indicate the importance of snow patch herbfields as refugia for dwarf alpine plant species in the face of climate change, the need for continued monitoring, the removal of feral animals from the Australian Alps and scenario planning.},

abstract = {Abstract Ecosystems across the world, and the biodiversity they support, are experiencing increasing anthropogenic pressure, and many will not persist without intervention. Given their complexity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has adopted an international standard for ecosystem risk assessment that builds on the strengths of the species-based Red List criteria. We applied this protocol to the relatively understudied Georgina gidgee woodland ecosystem, which has a patchy but widespread distribution in central Australia. To address the extensive knowledge gaps, we gathered data to provide the first description of the characteristic biota, distribution of dominant species and the processes that support the ecosystem. Criteria evaluated include historical, current and future declines in spatial distribution, the extent and area of occupancy, and disruptions to abiotic and biotic processes. Future declines in suitable habitat were based on key climatic variables of rainfall, temperature and soil substrate. We also quantified the uncertainty in bioclimatic models and scenarios as part of predicting degradation of the abiotic environment. Overall, we assessed the risk status of Georgina gidgee woodlands as vulnerable based on the degradation of abiotic and biotic processes. Bioclimatically suitable habitat was predicted to decline by at least 30\% in eight scenarios over the period 2000 to 2050. Predicted declines in overall suitable habitat varied substantially across all scenarios (7–95\%). Pressures from grazing, weed encroachment and altered fire regimes further threaten the ecosystem; therefore, vulnerable status was also recorded for future declines based on altered biotic processes. Accurate mapping and monitoring of the study ecosystem should receive priority to inform conservation decisions, and sustainable grazing practices encouraged. Our findings focus attention on other patchily distributed ecosystems that may also have escaped attention despite their contribution to supporting unique biodiversity and ecosystem services. It is timely that environmental monitoring and policy account for these natural assets.},

Few data existed and so we used literature and government biotic and abiotic data and anthropogenic impacts to assess the conservation risk of the ecosystem as Least Concern (IUCN Red List criteria for ecosystems, version 2.0). This was based on limited distributional change and low levels of degradation or anthropogenic threatening processes. The approach could be applied to ecosystem assessments of other large river basins around the world, given the Lake Eyre Basin occupies one extreme (unmodified) while the Aral Sea (collapsed), previously assessed, occupies the other extreme (highly modified). River flow analysis with available biotic data is critical for risk assessment as well as identification and tracking of long-term threats. Assessment was possible at this large basin scale and appropriate, given the critical importance of connectivity but could also occur at finer spatial scale. Increased diversions for irrigation, mining impacts on floodplains and projected increased temperatures threaten the current status (Least Concern) of the connected wetlands of the Lake Eyre Basin ecosystem.},

abstract = {Abstract Tidal flats provide ecosystem services to billions of people worldwide, yet their changing status is largely unknown. In the Yellow Sea region of East Asia, tidal flats are the principal coastal ecosystem fringing more than 4000 km of the coastlines of China, North Korea and South Korea. However, widespread loss of areal extent, increasing frequency of algal blooms, hypoxic dead zones and jellyfish blooms, and declines of commercial fisheries and migratory bird populations suggest that this ecosystem is degraded and declining. Here, we apply the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Ecosystems criteria to the Yellow Sea tidal flat ecosystem and determine that its status is endangered. Comparison of standardized remotely sensed habitat data and historic topographic map data indicated that in the last 50 years, a decline of more than 50\% but less than 80\% of tidal flat extent has occurred (criterion A1). Although restricted to a narrow band along the coastline, Yellow Sea tidal flats are sufficiently broadly distributed to be classified as least concern under criterion B. However, widespread pollution, algal blooms and declines of invertebrate and vertebrate fauna across the region result in a classification of endangered (C1, D1). Owing to the lack of long-term monitoring data and the unknown impacts of severe biotic and abiotic change, the ecosystem was scored as data deficient for Criterion E and several subcriteria. Our assessment demonstrates an urgent need to arrest the decline of the Yellow Sea tidal flat ecosystem, which could be achieved by (i) improved coastal planning and management at regional and national levels, (ii) expansion of the coastal protected area network, and (iii) improved managed of existing protected areas to reduce illegal land reclamation and coastal exploitation.},

abstract = {Abstract Human impacts threaten not only species, but also entire ecosystems. Ecosystems under stress can collapse or transition into different states, potentially reducing biodiversity at a variety of scales. Here we examine the vulnerability of Antarctic shallow invertebrate-dominated ecosystems, which may be threatened for several reasons. These unique shallow-water communities mostly consist of dark-adapted invertebrates, and rely on sea ice to create low-light marine environments. Climate change is likely to cause early breakout of seasonal sea ice in parts of Antarctica, which will dramatically increase the amount of light reaching shallow seabed. This is predicted to result in ecological regime shifts, in which invertebrate-dominated communities are replaced by macroalgal beds. Habitat for these endemic Antarctic ecosystems is globally rare, and the fragmented nature of their distribution along Antarctic coast increases their sensitivity to change. Concurrently, human activities in Antarctica are concentrated in areas where these habitats occur, compounding potential impacts. While there are clear mechanisms of threat to these ecosystems, lack of knowledge about their spatial distribution obscures predictions of potential ecosystem loss, and the likelihood of recovery. In this paper we describe these ecosystems, their association with the environment and the reasons for their vulnerability. We estimate their spatial distribution around Antarctica using sea ice and bathymetric data, and apply the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Ecosystems criteria to assess their vulnerability. Best available data suggest that shallow ice-covered ecosystems are likely Near Threatened to Vulnerable in places, although the magnitude of risk is spatially variable and requires additional data to strengthen the assessment.},
