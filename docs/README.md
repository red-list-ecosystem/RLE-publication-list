# IUCN Red List of Ecosystems

## Collection of References

This site includes a commented and curated list of publications related to IUCN Red List of Ecosystem (IUCN RLE) assessments (and other formal assessment of threats to ecosystem).

### Types of entries

We consider three types of publications in this collection:

* *Pre-assessment*: for information related to guidelines, methods and data gathering prior to the proper assessment.
* *Assessment*: for the actual implementation of the assessment following one set of guidelines, and presenting a proper outcome for each assessment unit.
* *Post-assessment*: for publications that summarize prior assessment outcomes.

Our main focus and priority is to summarize the state of progress of IUCN RLE asssessments of risk of collapse, but we also include references to other equivalent formal assessment of risk of elimination, loss or 'extinction' of ecosystem. In these cases we try to document the definition and use of categories and criteria as well as their outcomes.
